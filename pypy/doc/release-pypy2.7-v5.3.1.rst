==========
PyPy 5.3.1
==========

We have released a bugfix for PyPy2.7-v5.3.0, released last week,
due to issues_ reported by users.

Thanks to those who reported the issues.

.. _issues: https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/whatsnew-pypy2-5.3.1.html

What is PyPy?
=============

PyPy is a very compliant Python interpreter, almost a drop-in replacement for
CPython 2.7. It's fast (`PyPy and CPython 2.7.x`_ performance comparison)
due to its integrated tracing JIT compiler.

We also welcome developers of other
`dynamic languages`_ to see what RPython can do for them.

This release supports:

  * **x86** machines on most common operating systems
    (Linux 32/64, Mac OS X 64, Windows 32, OpenBSD, FreeBSD),

  * newer **ARM** hardware (ARMv6 or ARMv7, with VFPv3) running Linux,

  * big- and little-endian variants of **PPC64** running Linux,

  * **s390x** running Linux

.. _`PyPy and CPython 2.7.x`: https://speed.pypy.org
.. _`dynamic languages`: https://pypyjs.org

Please update, and continue to help us make PyPy better.

Cheers

The PyPy Team
