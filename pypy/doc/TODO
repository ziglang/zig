Documentation TODO
==================

General
-------

* architecture documents don't really show the separation between PyPy and
  RPython
  * architecture.rst is duplicate (both pypy and rpython)
* Consider moving information from pypy/doc/{build,windows}.rst to rpython/doc


Cleanup
~~~~~~~

* remove documentation on removed features
  * various object spaces
* update / remove dead links


Meta
~~~~

* work on configuration/options documentation generation


PyPy
----

* Update coding guide
* Move links from project-documentation.rst to index.rst and consider killing
  it.


RPython
-------

* make translation.rst a high-level overview and move details in their own
  documents
* redo various outdated pictures in translation.rst
