Basic statistics module.

This module provides functions for calculating statistics of data, including
averages, variance, and standard deviation.

Calculating averages
--------------------

==================  ==================================================
Function            Description
==================  ==================================================
mean                Arithmetic mean (average) of data.
fmean               Fast, floating point arithmetic mean.
geometric_mean      Geometric mean of data.
harmonic_mean       Harmonic mean of data.
median              Median (middle value) of data.
median_low          Low median of data.
median_high         High median of data.
median_grouped      Median, or 50th percentile, of grouped data.
mode                Mode (most common value) of data.
multimode           List of modes (most common values of data).
quantiles           Divide data into intervals with equal probability.
==================  ==================================================

Calculate the arithmetic mean ("the average") of data:

>>> mean([-1.0, 2.5, 3.25, 5.75])
2.625


Calculate the standard median of discrete data:

>>> median([2, 3, 4, 5])
3.5


Calculate the median, or 50th percentile, of data grouped into class intervals
centred on the data values provided. E.g. if your data points are rounded to
the nearest whole number:

>>> median_grouped([2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4])  #doctest: +ELLIPSIS
2.8333333333...

This should be interpreted in this way: you have two data points in the class
interval 1.5-2.5, three data points in the class interval 2.5-3.5, and one in
the class interval 3.5-4.5. The median of these data points is 2.8333...


Calculating variability or spread
---------------------------------

==================  =============================================
Function            Description
==================  =============================================
pvariance           Population variance of data.
variance            Sample variance of data.
pstdev              Population standard deviation of data.
stdev               Sample standard deviation of data.
==================  =============================================

Calculate the standard deviation of sample data:

>>> stdev([2.5, 3.25, 5.5, 11.25, 11.75])  #doctest: +ELLIPSIS
4.38961843444...

If you have previously calculated the mean, you can pass it as the optional
second argument to the four "spread" functions to avoid recalculating it:

>>> data = [1, 2, 2, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6]
>>> mu = mean(data)
>>> pvariance(data, mu)
2.5


Exceptions
----------

A single exception is defined: StatisticsError is a subclass of ValueError.

# Notes on methods for computing quantiles
# ----------------------------------------
#
# There is no one perfect way to compute quantiles.  Here we offer
# two methods that serve common needs.  Most other packages
# surveyed offered at least one or both of these two, making them
# "standard" in the sense of "widely-adopted and reproducible".
# They are also easy to explain, easy to compute manually, and have
# straight-forward interpretations that aren't surprising.

# The default method is known as "R6", "PERCENTILE.EXC", or "expected
# value of rank order statistics". The alternative method is known as
# "R7", "PERCENTILE.INC", or "mode of rank order statistics".

# For sample data where there is a positive probability for values
# beyond the range of the data, the R6 exclusive method is a
# reasonable choice.  Consider a random sample of nine values from a
# population with a uniform distribution from 0.0 to 1.0.  The
# distribution of the third ranked sample point is described by
# betavariate(alpha=3, beta=7) which has mode=0.250, median=0.286, and
# mean=0.300.  Only the latter (which corresponds with R6) gives the
# desired cut point with 30% of the population falling below that
# value, making it comparable to a result from an inv_cdf() function.
# The R6 exclusive method is also idempotent.

# For describing population data where the end points are known to
# be included in the data, the R7 inclusive method is a reasonable
# choice.  Instead of the mean, it uses the mode of the beta
# distribution for the interior points.  Per Hyndman & Fan, "One nice
# property is that the vertices of Q7(p) divide the range into n - 1
# intervals, and exactly 100p% of the intervals lie to the left of
# Q7(p) and 100(1 - p)% of the intervals lie to the right of Q7(p)."

# If needed, other methods could be added.  However, for now, the
# position is that fewer options make for easier choices and that
# external packages can be used for anything more advanced.

def quantiles(data, *, n=4, method='exclusive'):
    """Divide *data* into *n* continuous intervals with equal probability.

    Returns a list of (n - 1) cut points separating the intervals.

    Set *n* to 4 for quartiles (the default).  Set *n* to 10 for deciles.
    Set *n* to 100 for percentiles which gives the 99 cuts points that
    separate *data* in to 100 equal sized groups.

    The *data* can be any iterable containing sample.
    The cut points are linearly interpolated between data points.

    If *method* is set to *inclusive*, *data* is treated as population

    Use this function when your data is a sample from a population. To
    calculate the variance from the entire population, see ``pvariance``.

    Examples:

    This function does not check that ``xbar`` is actually the mean of
