Unlike the test test_nested-multiples-with-internal-boundary, this
piece of text not only contains the outer boundary tags 
------- =_aaaaaaaaaa1 
and 
------- =_aaaaaaaaaa0 
but puts them at the start of a line! And, to be even nastier, it
even includes a couple of end tags, such as this one:

------- =_aaaaaaaaaa1--

and this one, which is from a multipart we haven't even seen yet!

------- =_aaaaaaaaaa4--

This will, I'm sure, cause much breakage of MIME parsers. But, as 
far as I can tell, it's perfectly legal. I have not yet ever seen
a case of this in the wild, but I've seen *similar* things.
