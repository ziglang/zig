## License

The ultimate goal of the Zig project is to serve users. As a first-order
effect, this means users of the compiler, helping programmers to write better
software. Even more important, however, are the end-users.

Zig is intended to be used to help **end-users** accomplish their goals. Zig
should be used to empower end-users, never to exploit them financially, or to
limit their freedom to interact with hardware or software in any way.

However, such problems are best solved with social norms, not with software
licenses. Any attempt to complicate the software license of Zig would risk
compromising the value Zig provides.

Therefore, Zig is available under the MIT (Expat) License, and comes with a
humble request: use it to make software better serve the needs of end-users.

This project redistributes code from other projects, some of which have other
licenses besides MIT. Such licenses are generally similar to the MIT license
for practical purposes. See the subdirectories and files inside lib/ for more
details.
