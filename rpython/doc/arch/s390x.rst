.. _s390x:

IBM Mainframe S390X
===================

Our JIT implements the 64 bit version of the IBM Mainframe called s390x.
Note that this architecture is big endian.

Currently supported ISAs:

* z13 (released January 2015)
* zEC12 (released September 2012)
* z196 (released August 2010)
* z10 (released February 2008)

To check if all the necessary CPU facilities are installed
on the subject machine, please run the test using a copy of the pypy
source code::

    $ ./pytest.py rpython/jit/backend/zarch/test/test_assembler -v -k 'test_facility'

In addition you can run the auto encoding test to check if your Linux GCC tool chain
is able to compile all instructions used in the JIT backend::

    $ ./pytest.py rpython/jit/backend/zarch/test/test_auto_encoding.py -v

Translating
-----------

Specifically check for these two dependencies. On old versions of some
Linux distributions ship older versions.

* libffi (version should do > 3.0.+).
* CPython 2.7.+.
