     Regular expression support is provided by the PCRE library package,
     which is open source software, written by Philip Hazel, and copyright

   somewhere reasonably visible in your documentation and in any relevant

   the source, that is, to

   intended to apply to whole chains of software. If package A includes PCRE,
   it must acknowledge it, but if package B is software that includes package
