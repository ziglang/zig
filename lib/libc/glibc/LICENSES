     Regular expression support is provided by the PCRE library package,
     which is open source software, written by Philip Hazel, and copyright
     by the University of Cambridge, England.

   somewhere reasonably visible in your documentation and in any relevant
   files or online help data or similar. A reference to the ftp site for
   the source, that is, to

     ftp://ftp.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/software/programming/pcre/

   should also be given in the documentation. However, this condition is not
   intended to apply to whole chains of software. If package A includes PCRE,
   it must acknowledge it, but if package B is software that includes package
   A, the condition is not imposed on package B (unless it uses PCRE
   independently).

3. Altered versions must be plainly marked as such, and must not be
