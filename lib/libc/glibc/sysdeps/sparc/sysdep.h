/* The "-4" and "+4" offsets against _GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_ are
   critical since they represent the offset from the thunk call to the
   instruction containing the _GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_ reference.
   Therefore these instructions cannot be moved around without
   appropriate adjustments to those offsets.

   Furthermore, these expressions are special in another regard.  When
   the assembler sees a reference to _GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_ inside of
   a %hi() or %lo(), it emits a PC-relative relocation.  This causes
   R_SPARC_HI22 to turn into R_SPARC_PC22, and R_SPARC_LO10 to turn into
   R_SPARC_PC10, respectively.

   Even when v9 we use a call sequence instead of using "rd %pc" because
   RDPC is extremely expensive and incurs a full pipeline flush.  */
