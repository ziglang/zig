/* Support for clone call used on fork.  The signature varies across the

   1. long int clone (unsigned long flags, unsigned long newsp,

		      int *child_tidptr)

   2. long int clone (unsigned long newsp, unsigned long clone_flags,
		      int *parent_tidptr, int * child_tidptr,
		      unsigned long tls)

   3. long int clone (unsigned long flags, unsigned long newsp,
		      int stack_size, int *parent_tidptr,
		      int *child_tidptr, unsigned long tls)

   4. long int clone (unsigned long flags, unsigned long newsp,
		      int *parent_tidptr, int *child_tidptr,
		      unsigned long tls)

   The fourth variant is intended to be used as the default for newer ports,
   Also IA64 uses the third variant but with __NR_clone2 instead of
   __NR_clone.

   The macros names to define the variant used for the architecture is
   similar to kernel:

   - __ASSUME_CLONE_BACKWARDS: for variant 1.
   - __ASSUME_CLONE_BACKWARDS2: for variant 2 (s390).
   - __ASSUME_CLONE_BACKWARDS3: for variant 3 (microblaze).
   - __ASSUME_CLONE_DEFAULT: for variant 4.
   - __ASSUME_CLONE2: for clone2 with variant 3 (ia64).

/* Support for 64-bit time_t in the system call interface.  When this
   flag is set, the kernel provides a version of each of these system
   calls that accepts 64-bit time_t:

     clock_adjtime(64)
     clock_gettime(64)
     clock_settime(64)
     clock_getres(_time64)
     clock_nanosleep(_time64)
     futex(_time64)
     mq_timedreceive(_time64)
     mq_timedsend(_time64)
     ppoll(_time64)
     pselect6(_time64)
     rt_sigtimedwait(_time64)
     sched_rr_get_interval(_time64)
     timer_gettime(64)
     timer_settime(64)
     timerfd_gettime(64)
     timerfd_settime(64)
     utimensat(_time64)

   On architectures where time_t has historically been 64 bits,
   only the 64-bit version of each system call exists, and there
   are no suffixes on the __NR_ constants.

   On architectures where time_t has historically been 32 bits,
   both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of each system call may exist,
   depending on the kernel version.  When the 64-bit version exists,
   there is a '64' or '_time64' suffix on the name of its __NR_
   constant, as shown above.

   This flag is always set for Linux 5.1 and later.  Prior to that
   version, it is set only for some CPU architectures and ABIs:

   - __WORDSIZE == 64 - all supported architectures where pointers
     are 64 bits also have always had 64-bit time_t.

   - __WORDSIZE == 32 && __SYSCALL_WORDSIZE == 64 - this describes
     only one supported configuration, x86's 'x32' subarchitecture,
     where pointers are 32 bits but time_t has always been 64 bits.

   __ASSUME_TIME64_SYSCALLS being set does not mean __TIMESIZE is 64,
   and __TIMESIZE equal to 64 does not mean __ASSUME_TIME64_SYSCALLS
   is set.  All four cases are possible.  */
