/* The default way to check if the process is single thread is by using the
   pthread_t 'multiple_threads' field.  However, for some architectures it is
   faster to either use an extra field on TCB or global variables (the TCB
   field is also used on x86 for some single-thread atomic optimizations).

   The ABI might define SINGLE_THREAD_BY_GLOBAL to enable the single thread
   check to use global variables instead of the pthread_t field.  */
