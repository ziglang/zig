/* Use symbol_version_reference to specify the version a symbol
   reference should link to.  Use symbol_version or
   default_symbol_version for the definition of a versioned symbol.
   The difference is that the latter is a no-op in non-shared
   builds.

   _set_symbol_version is similar to symbol_version_reference, except
   that this macro expects the name and symbol version as a single
   string or token sequence, with an @ or @@ separator.  (A string is
   used in C mode and a token sequence in assembler mode.)
   _set_symbol_version only be used for definitions because it may
   introduce an alias symbol that would not be globally unique for
   mere references.  The _set_symbol_version macro is used to define
   default_symbol_version and compat_symbol.  */
