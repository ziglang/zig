/* Arch-specific definitions.  Each architecture must define the following
   macros to define the expected sizes of pthread data types:

   __SIZEOF_PTHREAD_ATTR_T        - size of pthread_attr_t.
   __SIZEOF_PTHREAD_MUTEX_T       - size of pthread_mutex_t.
   __SIZEOF_PTHREAD_MUTEXATTR_T   - size of pthread_mutexattr_t.
   __SIZEOF_PTHREAD_COND_T        - size of pthread_cond_t.
   __SIZEOF_PTHREAD_CONDATTR_T    - size of pthread_condattr_t.
   __SIZEOF_PTHREAD_RWLOCK_T      - size of pthread_rwlock_t.
   __SIZEOF_PTHREAD_RWLOCKATTR_T  - size of pthread_rwlockattr_t.
   __SIZEOF_PTHREAD_BARRIER_T     - size of pthread_barrier_t.
   __SIZEOF_PTHREAD_BARRIERATTR_T - size of pthread_barrierattr_t.

   The additional macro defines any constraint for the lock alignment
   inside the thread structures:

   __LOCK_ALIGNMENT - for internal lock/futex usage.

   Same idea but for the once locking primitive:

   __ONCE_ALIGNMENT - for pthread_once_t/once_flag definition.  */
