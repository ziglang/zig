 * AT_*CACHEBSIZE above represent the cache *block* size which is

 * It doesn't nececssarily matches the cache *line* size which is

 *
 * The set of entries below represent more extensive information
 * about the caches, in the form of two entry per cache type,
 * one entry containing the cache size in bytes, and the other
 * containing the cache line size in bytes in the bottom 16 bits
 * and the cache associativity in the next 16 bits.
 *
 * The associativity is such that if N is the 16-bit value, the
 * cache is N way set associative. A value if 0xffff means fully
 * associative, a value of 1 means directly mapped.
 *
 * For all these fields, a value of 0 means that the information
