/* RSEQ_SIG is a signature required before each abort handler code.

   It is a 32-bit value that maps to actual architecture code compiled
   into applications and libraries.  It needs to be defined for each
   architecture.  When choosing this value, it needs to be taken into
   account that generating invalid instructions may have ill effects on
   tools like objdump, and may also have impact on the CPU speculative
   execution efficiency in some cases.  */
