 * \brief C API: Collator 
 *
 * <h2> Collator C API </h2>
 *
 * The C API for Collator performs locale-sensitive
 * string comparison. You use this service to build
 * searching and sorting routines for natural language text.
 * <p>
 * For more information about the collation service see 
 * <a href="https://unicode-org.github.io/icu/userguide/collation">the User Guide</a>.
 * <p>
 * Collation service provides correct sorting orders for most locales supported in ICU. 
 * If specific data for a locale is not available, the orders eventually falls back
 * to the <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-collation.html#Root_Collation">CLDR root sort order</a>. 
 * <p>
 * Sort ordering may be customized by providing your own set of rules. For more on
 * this subject see the <a href="https://unicode-org.github.io/icu/userguide/collation/customization">
 * Collation Customization</a> section of the User Guide.
 * <p>

 * Collation reordering allows scripts and some other groups of characters
 * to be moved relative to each other. This reordering is done on top of
 * the DUCET/CLDR standard collation order. Reordering can specify groups to be placed 
 * at the start and/or the end of the collation order. These groups are specified using
 * UScript codes and UColReorderCode entries.
 *
 * <p>By default, reordering codes specified for the start of the order are placed in the 
 * order given after several special non-script blocks. These special groups of characters
 * are space, punctuation, symbol, currency, and digit. These special groups are represented with
 * UColReorderCode entries. Script groups can be intermingled with 
 * these special non-script groups if those special groups are explicitly specified in the reordering.
 *
 * <p>The special code OTHERS stands for any script that is not explicitly 
 * mentioned in the list of reordering codes given. Anything that is after OTHERS
 * will go at the very end of the reordering in the order given.
 *
 * <p>The special reorder code DEFAULT will reset the reordering for this collator
 * to the default for this collator. The default reordering may be the DUCET/CLDR order or may be a reordering that
 * was specified when this collator was created from resource data or from rules. The 
 * DEFAULT code <b>must</b> be the sole code supplied when it is used.
 * If not, then U_ILLEGAL_ARGUMENT_ERROR will be set.
 *
 * <p>The special reorder code NONE will remove any reordering for this collator.
 * The result of setting no reordering will be to have the DUCET/CLDR ordering used. The 
 * NONE code <b>must</b> be the sole code supplied when it is used.
 *
