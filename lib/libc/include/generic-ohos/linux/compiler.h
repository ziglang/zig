 ***   This header was automatically generated from a Linux kernel header
 ***   of the same name, to make information necessary for userspace to
 ***   call into the kernel available to libc.  It contains only constants,
 ***   structures, and macros generated from the original header, and thus,
 ***   contains no copyrightable information.
 ***
 ***   To edit the content of this header, modify the corresponding
 ***   source file (e.g. under external/kernel-headers/original/) then
 ***   run bionic/libc/kernel/tools/update_all.py
 ***
 ***   Any manual change here will be lost the next time this script will
 ***   be run. You've been warned!

 * This file is not currently in the Linux kernel tree.
 * Upstream uapi headers refer to <linux/compiler.h> but there is
 * no such uapi file. We've sent this upstream, and are optimistically
 * adding it to bionic in the meantime. This should be replaced by
 * a scrubbed header from external/kernel-headers when possible.
 *
 * An alternative to this file is to check in a symbolic link to the
 * non-uapi <linux/compiler.h>. That's fine for building bionic too.
