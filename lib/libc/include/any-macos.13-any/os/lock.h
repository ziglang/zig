/*!
 * @typedef os_unfair_lock
 *
 * @abstract
 * Low-level lock that allows waiters to block efficiently on contention.
 *
 * os_unfair_lock is an appropriate lock for cases where simple and lightweight
 * mutual exclusion is needed.
 * It can be intrusively stored inline in a datastructure without needing a
 * separate allocation, reducing memory consumption and cost of indirection.
 * For situations where something more sophisticated like condition waits or
 * FIFO ordering is needed, use appropriate higher level APIs such as those from
 * the pthread or dispatch subsystems.
 *
 * The values stored in the lock should be considered opaque and implementation
 * defined, they contain thread ownership information that the system may use
 * to attempt to resolve priority inversions.
 *
 * This lock must be unlocked from the same thread that locked it, attempts to
 * unlock from a different thread will cause an assertion aborting the process.
 *
 * This lock must not be accessed from multiple processes or threads via shared
 * or multiply-mapped memory, because the lock implementation relies on the
 * address of the lock value and identity of the owning process.
 *
 * Must be initialized with OS_UNFAIR_LOCK_INIT.
 *
 * @discussion
 * The name 'unfair' indicates that there is no attempt at enforcing acquisition
 * fairness, e.g. an unlocker can potentially immediately reacquire the lock
 * before a woken up waiter gets an opportunity to attempt to acquire the lock.
 * This is often advantageous for performance reasons, but also makes starvation
 * of waiters a possibility.
 *
 * This lock is suitable as a drop-in replacement for the deprecated OSSpinLock,
 * providing much better behavior under contention.
 *
 * In Swift, note that use of the `&` operator on an unfair lock can copy or move
 * the lock memory, leading to misbehavior. Use an OSAllocatedUnfairLock to safely wrap
 * access to the lock memory instead. If you use os_unfair_lock APIs directly,
 * always make sure to store and use the lock in memory with a stable address.
