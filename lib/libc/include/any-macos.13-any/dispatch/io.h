 * Dispatch I/O provides both stream and random access asynchronous read and
 * write operations on file descriptors. One or more dispatch I/O channels may
 * be created from a file descriptor as either the DISPATCH_IO_STREAM type or
 * DISPATCH_IO_RANDOM type. Once a channel has been created the application may
 * schedule asynchronous read and write operations.
 *
 * The application may set policies on the dispatch I/O channel to indicate the
 * desired frequency of I/O handlers for long-running operations.
 *
 * Dispatch I/O also provides a memory management model for I/O buffers that
 * avoids unnecessary copying of data when pipelined between channels. Dispatch
 * I/O monitors the overall memory pressure and I/O access patterns for the
 * application to optimize resource utilization.
