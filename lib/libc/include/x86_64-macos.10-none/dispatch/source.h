 * a call must be made to dispatch_activate() in order to begin event delivery.
 *
 * Calling dispatch_set_target_queue() on a source once it has been activated
 * is not allowed (see dispatch_activate() and dispatch_set_target_queue()).
 *
 * For backward compatibility reasons, dispatch_resume() on an inactive,

 * Once this function returns, any pending source data accumulated for the

 * occur at 'start', and every 'interval' nanoseconds thereafter until the
 * timer source is canceled.
 *
 * Any fire of the timer may be delayed by the system in order to improve power
 * consumption and system performance. The upper limit to the allowable delay
 * may be configured with the 'leeway' argument, the lower limit is under the
 * control of the system.
 *
 * For the initial timer fire at 'start', the upper limit to the allowable
 * delay is set to 'leeway' nanoseconds. For the subsequent timer fires at
 * 'start' + N * 'interval', the upper limit is MIN('leeway','interval'/2).
 *
 * The lower limit to the allowable delay may vary with process state such as
 * visibility of application UI. If the specified timer source was created with
 * a mask of DISPATCH_TIMER_STRICT, the system will make a best effort to
 * strictly observe the provided 'leeway' value even if it is smaller than the
 * current lower limit. Note that a minimal amount of delay is to be expected
 * even if this flag is specified.
 *
 * The 'start' argument also determines which clock will be used for the timer:
 * If 'start' is DISPATCH_TIME_NOW or was created with dispatch_time(3), the
 * timer is based on up time (which is obtained from mach_absolute_time() on
