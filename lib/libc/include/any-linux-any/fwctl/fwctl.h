/**
 * DOC: General ioctl format
 *
 * The ioctl interface follows a general format to allow for extensibility. Each
 * ioctl is passed a structure pointer as the argument providing the size of
 * the structure in the first u32. The kernel checks that any structure space
 * beyond what it understands is 0. This allows userspace to use the backward
 * compatible portion while consistently using the newer, larger, structures.
 *
 * ioctls use a standard meaning for common errnos:
 *
 *  - ENOTTY: The IOCTL number itself is not supported at all
 *  - E2BIG: The IOCTL number is supported, but the provided structure has
 *    non-zero in a part the kernel does not understand.
 *  - EOPNOTSUPP: The IOCTL number is supported, and the structure is
 *    understood, however a known field has a value the kernel does not
 *    understand or support.
 *  - EINVAL: Everything about the IOCTL was understood, but a field is not
 *    correct.
 *  - ENOMEM: Out of memory.
 *  - ENODEV: The underlying device has been hot-unplugged and the FD is
 *            orphaned.
 *
 * As well as additional errnos, within specific ioctls.
