 * generic msqid64_ds structure.

 * Note extra padding because this structure is passed back and forth
 * between kernel and user space.
 *
 * msqid64_ds was originally meant to be architecture specific, but
 * everyone just ended up making identical copies without specific
 * optimizations, so we may just as well all use the same one.
 *
 * 64 bit architectures use a 64-bit long time field here, while
 * 32 bit architectures have a pair of unsigned long values.
 * On big-endian systems, the lower half is in the wrong place.
 *
 * Pad space is left for:
 * - 2 miscellaneous 32-bit values
