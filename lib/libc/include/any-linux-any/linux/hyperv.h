/*
 * In Linux, we implement the KVP functionality in two components:
 * 1) The kernel component which is packaged as part of the hv_utils driver
 * is responsible for communicating with the host and responsible for
 * implementing the host/guest protocol. 2) A user level daemon that is
 * responsible for data gathering.
 *
 * Host/Guest Protocol: The host iterates over an index and expects the guest
 * to assign a key name to the index and also return the value corresponding to
 * the key. The host will have atmost one KVP transaction outstanding at any
 * given point in time. The host side iteration stops when the guest returns
 * an error. Microsoft has specified the following mapping of key names to
 * host specified index:
 *
 *	Index		Key Name
 *	0		FullyQualifiedDomainName
 *	1		IntegrationServicesVersion
 *	2		NetworkAddressIPv4
 *	3		NetworkAddressIPv6
 *	4		OSBuildNumber
 *	5		OSName
 *	6		OSMajorVersion
 *	7		OSMinorVersion
 *	8		OSVersion
 *	9		ProcessorArchitecture
 *
 * The Windows host expects the Key Name and Key Value to be encoded in utf16.
 *
 * Guest Kernel/KVP Daemon Protocol: As noted earlier, we implement all of the
 * data gathering functionality in a user mode daemon. The user level daemon
 * is also responsible for binding the key name to the index as well. The
 * kernel and user-level daemon communicate using a connector channel.
 *
 * The user mode component first registers with the
 * kernel component. Subsequently, the kernel component requests, data
 * for the specified keys. In response to this message the user mode component
 * fills in the value corresponding to the specified key. We overload the
 * sequence field in the cn_msg header to define our KVP message types.
 *
 *
 * The kernel component simply acts as a conduit for communication between the
 * Windows host and the user-level daemon. The kernel component passes up the
 * index received from the Host to the user-level daemon. If the index is
 * valid (supported), the corresponding key as well as its
 * value (both are strings) is returned. If the index is invalid
 * (not supported), a NULL key string is returned.

/*
 * As we look at expanding the KVP functionality to include
 * IP injection functionality, we need to maintain binary
 * compatibility with older daemons.
 *
 * The KVP opcodes are defined by the host and it was unfortunate
 * that I chose to treat the registration operation as part of the
 * KVP operations defined by the host.
 * Here is the level of compatibility
 * (between the user level daemon and the kernel KVP driver) that we
 * will implement:
 *
 * An older daemon will always be supported on a newer driver.
 * A given user level daemon will require a minimal version of the
 * kernel driver.
 * If we cannot handle the version differences, we will fail gracefully
 * (this can happen when we have a user level daemon that is more
 * advanced than the KVP driver.
 *
 * We will use values used in this handshake for determining if we have
 * workable user level daemon and the kernel driver. We begin by taking the
 * registration opcode out of the KVP opcode namespace. We will however,
 * maintain compatibility with the existing user-level daemon code.
