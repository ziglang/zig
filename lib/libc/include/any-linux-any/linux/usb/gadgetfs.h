 * i/o requests.  When ep0 is configured, the device can enumerate;
 * when it's closed, the device disconnects from usb.  Operations on
 * ep0 require ioctl() operations.
 *
 * Configuration and device descriptors get written to /dev/gadget/$CHIP,
 * which may then be used to read usb_gadgetfs_event structs.  The driver
 * may activate endpoints as it handles SET_CONFIGURATION setup events,
 * or earlier; writing endpoint descriptors to /dev/gadget/$ENDPOINT
 * then performing data transfers by reading or writing.
