 * Lock status block
 *
 * Use this structure to specify the contents of the lock value block.  For a
 * conversion request, this structure is used to specify the lock ID of the
 * lock.  DLM writes the status of the lock request and the lock ID assigned
 * to the request in the lock status block.
 *
 * sb_lkid: the returned lock ID.  It is set on new (non-conversion) requests.
 * It is available when dlm_lock returns.
 *
 * sb_lvbptr: saves or returns the contents of the lock's LVB according to rules
 * shown for the DLM_LKF_VALBLK flag.
 *
 * sb_flags: DLM_SBF_DEMOTED is returned if in the process of promoting a lock,
 * it was first demoted to NL to avoid conversion deadlock.
 * DLM_SBF_VALNOTVALID is returned if the resource's LVB is marked invalid.
 *
 * sb_status: the returned status of the lock request set prior to AST
 * execution.  Possible return values:
 *
 * 0 if lock request was successful
 * -EAGAIN if request would block and is flagged DLM_LKF_NOQUEUE
 * -DLM_EUNLOCK if unlock request was successful
 * -DLM_ECANCEL if a cancel completed successfully
 * -EDEADLK if a deadlock was detected
 * -ETIMEDOUT if the lock request was canceled due to a timeout
