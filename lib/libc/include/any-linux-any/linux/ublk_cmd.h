 * by enabling fixed buffers (e.g. using IORING_OP_{READ,WRITE}_FIXED or
 * IORING_URING_CMD_FIXED) and passing the registered buffer index in buf_index.
 * Once the last io_uring operation using the request's buffer has completed,
 * the ublk server submits a UBLK_U_IO_UNREGISTER_IO_BUF command with q_id, tag,
 * and addr again specifying the request buffer to unregister.
 * The ublk request is completed when its buffer is unregistered from all

 * - ublk server has to create sparse buffer table on the same `io_ring_ctx`
 *   for issuing `UBLK_IO_FETCH_REQ` and `UBLK_IO_COMMIT_AND_FETCH_REQ`.
 *   If uring_cmd isn't issued on same `io_ring_ctx`, it is ublk server's
 *   responsibility to unregister the buffer by issuing `IO_UNREGISTER_IO_BUF`
 *   manually, otherwise this ublk request won't complete.
 *
 * - ublk server passes auto buf register data via uring_cmd's sqe->addr,
 *   `struct ublk_auto_buf_reg` is populated from sqe->addr, please see
 *   the definition of ublk_sqe_addr_to_auto_buf_reg()
 *
 * - pass buffer index from `ublk_auto_buf_reg.index`
 *
 * - all reserved fields in `ublk_auto_buf_reg` need to be zeroed
 *
 * - pass flags from `ublk_auto_buf_reg.flags` if needed
 *
 * This way avoids extra cost from two uring_cmd, but also simplifies backend
 * implementation, such as, the dependency on IO_REGISTER_IO_BUF and
 * IO_UNREGISTER_IO_BUF becomes not necessary.
 *
 * If wrong data or flags are provided, both IO_FETCH_REQ and
 * IO_COMMIT_AND_FETCH_REQ are failed, for the latter, the ublk IO request
