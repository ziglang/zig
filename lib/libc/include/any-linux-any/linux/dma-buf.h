/**
 * struct dma_buf_sync - Synchronize with CPU access.
 *
 * When a DMA buffer is accessed from the CPU via mmap, it is not always
 * possible to guarantee coherency between the CPU-visible map and underlying
 * memory.  To manage coherency, DMA_BUF_IOCTL_SYNC must be used to bracket
 * any CPU access to give the kernel the chance to shuffle memory around if
 * needed.
 *
 * Prior to accessing the map, the client must call DMA_BUF_IOCTL_SYNC
 * with DMA_BUF_SYNC_START and the appropriate read/write flags.  Once the
 * access is complete, the client should call DMA_BUF_IOCTL_SYNC with
 * DMA_BUF_SYNC_END and the same read/write flags.
 *
 * The synchronization provided via DMA_BUF_IOCTL_SYNC only provides cache
 * coherency.  It does not prevent other processes or devices from
 * accessing the memory at the same time.  If synchronization with a GPU or
 * other device driver is required, it is the client's responsibility to
 * wait for buffer to be ready for reading or writing before calling this
 * ioctl with DMA_BUF_SYNC_START.  Likewise, the client must ensure that
 * follow-up work is not submitted to GPU or other device driver until
 * after this ioctl has been called with DMA_BUF_SYNC_END?
 *
 * If the driver or API with which the client is interacting uses implicit
 * synchronization, waiting for prior work to complete can be done via
 * poll() on the DMA buffer file descriptor.  If the driver or API requires
 * explicit synchronization, the client may have to wait on a sync_file or
 * other synchronization primitive outside the scope of the DMA buffer API.

/**
 * struct dma_buf_export_sync_file - Get a sync_file from a dma-buf
 *
 * Userspace can perform a DMA_BUF_IOCTL_EXPORT_SYNC_FILE to retrieve the
 * current set of fences on a dma-buf file descriptor as a sync_file.  CPU
 * waits via poll() or other driver-specific mechanisms typically wait on
 * whatever fences are on the dma-buf at the time the wait begins.  This
 * is similar except that it takes a snapshot of the current fences on the
 * dma-buf for waiting later instead of waiting immediately.  This is
 * useful for modern graphics APIs such as Vulkan which assume an explicit
 * synchronization model but still need to inter-operate with dma-buf.
 *
 * The intended usage pattern is the following:
 *
 *  1. Export a sync_file with flags corresponding to the expected GPU usage
 *     via DMA_BUF_IOCTL_EXPORT_SYNC_FILE.
 *
 *  2. Submit rendering work which uses the dma-buf.  The work should wait on
 *     the exported sync file before rendering and produce another sync_file
 *     when complete.
 *
 *  3. Import the rendering-complete sync_file into the dma-buf with flags
 *     corresponding to the GPU usage via DMA_BUF_IOCTL_IMPORT_SYNC_FILE.
 *
 * Unlike doing implicit synchronization via a GPU kernel driver's exec ioctl,
 * the above is not a single atomic operation.  If userspace wants to ensure
 * ordering via these fences, it is the respnosibility of userspace to use
 * locks or other mechanisms to ensure that no other context adds fences or
 * submits work between steps 1 and 3 above.
