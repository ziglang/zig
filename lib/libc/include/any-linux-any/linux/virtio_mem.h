/*
 * Each virtio-mem device manages a dedicated region in physical address
 * space. Each device can belong to a single NUMA node, multiple devices
 * for a single NUMA node are possible. A virtio-mem device is like a
 * "resizable DIMM" consisting of small memory blocks that can be plugged
 * or unplugged. The device driver is responsible for (un)plugging memory
 * blocks on demand.
 *
 * Virtio-mem devices can only operate on their assigned memory region in
 * order to (un)plug memory. A device cannot (un)plug memory belonging to
 * other devices.
 *
 * The "region_size" corresponds to the maximum amount of memory that can
 * be provided by a device. The "size" corresponds to the amount of memory
 * that is currently plugged. "requested_size" corresponds to a request
 * from the device to the device driver to (un)plug blocks. The
 * device driver should try to (un)plug blocks in order to reach the
 * "requested_size". It is impossible to plug more memory than requested.
 *
 * The "usable_region_size" represents the memory region that can actually
 * be used to (un)plug memory. It is always at least as big as the
 * "requested_size" and will grow dynamically. It will only shrink when
 * explicitly triggered (VIRTIO_MEM_REQ_UNPLUG).
 *
 * There are no guarantees what will happen if unplugged memory is
 * read/written. In general, unplugged memory should not be touched, because
 * the resulting action is undefined. There is one exception: without
 * VIRTIO_MEM_F_UNPLUGGED_INACCESSIBLE, unplugged memory inside the usable
 * region can be read, to simplify creation of memory dumps.
 *
 * It can happen that the device cannot process a request, because it is
 * busy. The device driver has to retry later.
 *
 * Usually, during system resets all memory will get unplugged, so the
 * device driver can start with a clean state. However, in specific
 * scenarios (if the device is busy) it can happen that the device still
 * has memory plugged. The device driver can request to unplug all memory
 * (VIRTIO_MEM_REQ_UNPLUG) - which might take a while to succeed if the
 * device is busy.
