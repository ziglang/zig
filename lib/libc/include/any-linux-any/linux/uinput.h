 * UI_DEV_SETUP - Set device parameters for setup
 *
 * This ioctl sets parameters for the input device to be created.  It
 * supersedes the old "struct uinput_user_dev" method, which wrote this data
 * via write(). To actually set the absolute axes UI_ABS_SETUP should be
 * used.
 *
 * The ioctl takes a "struct uinput_setup" object as argument. The fields of
 * this object are as follows:
 *              id: See the description of "struct input_id". This field is
 *                  copied unchanged into the new device.
 *            name: This is used unchanged as name for the new device.
 *  ff_effects_max: This limits the maximum numbers of force-feedback effects.
 *                  See below for a description of FF with uinput.
 *
 * This ioctl can be called multiple times and will overwrite previous values.
 * If this ioctl fails with -EINVAL, it is recommended to use the old
 * "uinput_user_dev" method via write() as a fallback, in case you run on an
 * old kernel that does not support this ioctl.
 *
 * This ioctl may fail with -EINVAL if it is not supported or if you passed
 * incorrect values, -ENOMEM if the kernel runs out of memory or -EFAULT if the
 * passed uinput_setup object cannot be read/written.
 * If this call fails, partial data may have already been applied to the
 * internal device.

 *
 * The ioctl takes a "struct uinput_abs_setup" object as argument. The fields
 * of this object are as follows:
 *            code: The corresponding input code associated with this axis
 *                  (ABS_X, ABS_Y, etc...)
 *         absinfo: See "struct input_absinfo" for a description of this field.
 *                  This field is copied unchanged into the kernel for the
 *                  specified axis. If the axis is not enabled via
 *                  UI_SET_ABSBIT, this ioctl will enable it.

/*
 * To write a force-feedback-capable driver, the upload_effect
 * and erase_effect callbacks in input_dev must be implemented.
 * The uinput driver will generate a fake input event when one of
 * these callbacks are invoked. The userspace code then uses
 * ioctls to retrieve additional parameters and send the return code.
 * The callback blocks until this return code is sent.
 *
 * The described callback mechanism is only used if ff_effects_max
 * is set.
 *
 * To implement upload_effect():
 *   1. Wait for an event with type == EV_UINPUT and code == UI_FF_UPLOAD.
 *      A request ID will be given in 'value'.
 *   2. Allocate a uinput_ff_upload struct, fill in request_id with
 *      the 'value' from the EV_UINPUT event.
 *   3. Issue a UI_BEGIN_FF_UPLOAD ioctl, giving it the
 *      uinput_ff_upload struct. It will be filled in with the
 *      ff_effects passed to upload_effect().
 *   4. Perform the effect upload, and place a return code back into
        the uinput_ff_upload struct.
 *   5. Issue a UI_END_FF_UPLOAD ioctl, also giving it the
 *      uinput_ff_upload_effect struct. This will complete execution
 *      of our upload_effect() handler.
 *
 * To implement erase_effect():
 *   1. Wait for an event with type == EV_UINPUT and code == UI_FF_ERASE.
 *      A request ID will be given in 'value'.
 *   2. Allocate a uinput_ff_erase struct, fill in request_id with
 *      the 'value' from the EV_UINPUT event.
 *   3. Issue a UI_BEGIN_FF_ERASE ioctl, giving it the
 *      uinput_ff_erase struct. It will be filled in with the
 *      effect ID passed to erase_effect().
 *   4. Perform the effect erasure, and place a return code back
 *      into the uinput_ff_erase struct.
 *   5. Issue a UI_END_FF_ERASE ioctl, also giving it the
 *      uinput_ff_erase_effect struct. This will complete execution
