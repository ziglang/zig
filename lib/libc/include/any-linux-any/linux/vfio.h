/*
 * The device migration Finite State Machine is described by the enum
 * vfio_device_mig_state. Some of the FSM arcs will create a migration data
 * transfer session by returning a FD, in this case the migration data will
 * flow over the FD using read() and write() as discussed below.
 *
 * There are 5 states to support VFIO_MIGRATION_STOP_COPY:
 *  RUNNING - The device is running normally
 *  STOP - The device does not change the internal or external state
 *  STOP_COPY - The device internal state can be read out
 *  RESUMING - The device is stopped and is loading a new internal state
 *  ERROR - The device has failed and must be reset
 *
 * And optional states to support VFIO_MIGRATION_P2P:
 *  RUNNING_P2P - RUNNING, except the device cannot do peer to peer DMA
 * And VFIO_MIGRATION_PRE_COPY:
 *  PRE_COPY - The device is running normally but tracking internal state
 *             changes
 * And VFIO_MIGRATION_P2P | VFIO_MIGRATION_PRE_COPY:
 *  PRE_COPY_P2P - PRE_COPY, except the device cannot do peer to peer DMA
 *
 * The FSM takes actions on the arcs between FSM states. The driver implements
 * the following behavior for the FSM arcs:
 *
 * RUNNING_P2P -> STOP
 * STOP_COPY -> STOP
 *   While in STOP the device must stop the operation of the device. The device
 *   must not generate interrupts, DMA, or any other change to external state.
 *   It must not change its internal state. When stopped the device and kernel
 *   migration driver must accept and respond to interaction to support external
 *   subsystems in the STOP state, for example PCI MSI-X and PCI config space.
 *   Failure by the user to restrict device access while in STOP must not result
 *   in error conditions outside the user context (ex. host system faults).
 *
 *   The STOP_COPY arc will terminate a data transfer session.
 *
 * RESUMING -> STOP
 *   Leaving RESUMING terminates a data transfer session and indicates the
 *   device should complete processing of the data delivered by write(). The
 *   kernel migration driver should complete the incorporation of data written
 *   to the data transfer FD into the device internal state and perform
 *   final validity and consistency checking of the new device state. If the
 *   user provided data is found to be incomplete, inconsistent, or otherwise
 *   invalid, the migration driver must fail the SET_STATE ioctl and
 *   optionally go to the ERROR state as described below.
 *
 *   While in STOP the device has the same behavior as other STOP states
 *   described above.
 *
 *   To abort a RESUMING session the device must be reset.
 *
 * PRE_COPY -> RUNNING
 * RUNNING_P2P -> RUNNING
 *   While in RUNNING the device is fully operational, the device may generate
 *   interrupts, DMA, respond to MMIO, all vfio device regions are functional,
 *   and the device may advance its internal state.
 *
 *   The PRE_COPY arc will terminate a data transfer session.
 *
 * PRE_COPY_P2P -> RUNNING_P2P
 * RUNNING -> RUNNING_P2P
 * STOP -> RUNNING_P2P
 *   While in RUNNING_P2P the device is partially running in the P2P quiescent
 *   state defined below.
 *
 *   The PRE_COPY_P2P arc will terminate a data transfer session.
 *
 * RUNNING -> PRE_COPY
 * RUNNING_P2P -> PRE_COPY_P2P
 * STOP -> STOP_COPY
 *   PRE_COPY, PRE_COPY_P2P and STOP_COPY form the "saving group" of states
 *   which share a data transfer session. Moving between these states alters
 *   what is streamed in session, but does not terminate or otherwise affect
 *   the associated fd.
 *
 *   These arcs begin the process of saving the device state and will return a
 *   new data_fd. The migration driver may perform actions such as enabling
 *   dirty logging of device state when entering PRE_COPY or PER_COPY_P2P.
 *
 *   Each arc does not change the device operation, the device remains
 *   RUNNING, P2P quiesced or in STOP. The STOP_COPY state is described below
 *   in PRE_COPY_P2P -> STOP_COPY.
 *
 * PRE_COPY -> PRE_COPY_P2P
 *   Entering PRE_COPY_P2P continues all the behaviors of PRE_COPY above.
 *   However, while in the PRE_COPY_P2P state, the device is partially running
 *   in the P2P quiescent state defined below, like RUNNING_P2P.
 *
 * PRE_COPY_P2P -> PRE_COPY
 *   This arc allows returning the device to a full RUNNING behavior while
 *   continuing all the behaviors of PRE_COPY.
 *
 * PRE_COPY_P2P -> STOP_COPY
 *   While in the STOP_COPY state the device has the same behavior as STOP
 *   with the addition that the data transfers session continues to stream the
 *   migration state. End of stream on the FD indicates the entire device
 *   state has been transferred.
 *
 *   The user should take steps to restrict access to vfio device regions while
 *   the device is in STOP_COPY or risk corruption of the device migration data
 *   stream.
 *
 * STOP -> RESUMING
 *   Entering the RESUMING state starts a process of restoring the device state
 *   and will return a new data_fd. The data stream fed into the data_fd should
 *   be taken from the data transfer output of a single FD during saving from
 *   a compatible device. The migration driver may alter/reset the internal
 *   device state for this arc if required to prepare the device to receive the
 *   migration data.
 *
 * STOP_COPY -> PRE_COPY
 * STOP_COPY -> PRE_COPY_P2P
 *   These arcs are not permitted and return error if requested. Future
 *   revisions of this API may define behaviors for these arcs, in this case
 *   support will be discoverable by a new flag in
 *   VFIO_DEVICE_FEATURE_MIGRATION.
 *
 * any -> ERROR
 *   ERROR cannot be specified as a device state, however any transition request
 *   can be failed with an errno return and may then move the device_state into
 *   ERROR. In this case the device was unable to execute the requested arc and
 *   was also unable to restore the device to any valid device_state.
 *   To recover from ERROR VFIO_DEVICE_RESET must be used to return the
 *   device_state back to RUNNING.
 *
 * The optional peer to peer (P2P) quiescent state is intended to be a quiescent
 * state for the device for the purposes of managing multiple devices within a
 * user context where peer-to-peer DMA between devices may be active. The
 * RUNNING_P2P and PRE_COPY_P2P states must prevent the device from initiating
 * any new P2P DMA transactions. If the device can identify P2P transactions
 * then it can stop only P2P DMA, otherwise it must stop all DMA. The migration
 * driver must complete any such outstanding operations prior to completing the
 * FSM arc into a P2P state. For the purpose of specification the states
 * behave as though the device was fully running if not supported. Like while in
 * STOP or STOP_COPY the user must not touch the device, otherwise the state
 * can be exited.
 *
 * The remaining possible transitions are interpreted as combinations of the
 * above FSM arcs. As there are multiple paths through the FSM arcs the path
 * should be selected based on the following rules:
 *   - Select the shortest path.
 *   - The path cannot have saving group states as interior arcs, only
 *     starting/end states.
 * Refer to vfio_mig_get_next_state() for the result of the algorithm.
 *
 * The automatic transit through the FSM arcs that make up the combination
 * transition is invisible to the user. When working with combination arcs the
 * user may see any step along the path in the device_state if SET_STATE
 * fails. When handling these types of errors users should anticipate future
 * revisions of this protocol using new states and those states becoming
 * visible in this case.
 *
 * The optional states cannot be used with SET_STATE if the device does not
 * support them. The user can discover if these states are supported by using
 * VFIO_DEVICE_FEATURE_MIGRATION. By using combination transitions the user can
 * avoid knowing about these optional states if the kernel driver supports them.
 *
 * Arcs touching PRE_COPY and PRE_COPY_P2P are removed if support for PRE_COPY
 * is not present.

 * VFIO_MIG_GET_PRECOPY_INFO - _IO(VFIO_TYPE, VFIO_BASE + 21)
 *
 * This ioctl is used on the migration data FD in the precopy phase of the
 * migration data transfer. It returns an estimate of the current data sizes
 * remaining to be transferred. It allows the user to judge when it is
 * appropriate to leave PRE_COPY for STOP_COPY.
 *
 * This ioctl is valid only in PRE_COPY states and kernel driver should
 * return -EINVAL from any other migration state.
 *
 * The vfio_precopy_info data structure returned by this ioctl provides
 * estimates of data available from the device during the PRE_COPY states.
 * This estimate is split into two categories, initial_bytes and
 * dirty_bytes.
 *
 * The initial_bytes field indicates the amount of initial precopy
 * data available from the device. This field should have a non-zero initial
 * value and decrease as migration data is read from the device.
 * It is recommended to leave PRE_COPY for STOP_COPY only after this field
 * reaches zero. Leaving PRE_COPY earlier might make things slower.
 *
 * The dirty_bytes field tracks device state changes relative to data
 * previously retrieved.  This field starts at zero and may increase as
 * the internal device state is modified or decrease as that modified
 * state is read from the device.
 *
 * Userspace may use the combination of these fields to estimate the
 * potential data size available during the PRE_COPY phases, as well as
 * trends relative to the rate the device is dirtying its internal
 * state, but these fields are not required to have any bearing relative
 * to the data size available during the STOP_COPY phase.
 *
 * Drivers have a lot of flexibility in when and what they transfer during the
 * PRE_COPY phase, and how they report this from VFIO_MIG_GET_PRECOPY_INFO.
 *
 * During pre-copy the migration data FD has a temporary "end of stream" that is
 * reached when both initial_bytes and dirty_byte are zero. For instance, this
 * may indicate that the device is idle and not currently dirtying any internal
 * state. When read() is done on this temporary end of stream the kernel driver
 * should return ENOMSG from read(). Userspace can wait for more data (which may
 * never come) by using poll.
 *
 * Once in STOP_COPY the migration data FD has a permanent end of stream
 * signaled in the usual way by read() always returning 0 and poll always
 * returning readable. ENOMSG may not be returned in STOP_COPY.
 * Support for this ioctl is mandatory if a driver claims to support
 * VFIO_MIGRATION_PRE_COPY.
 *
 * Return: 0 on success, -1 and errno set on failure.
