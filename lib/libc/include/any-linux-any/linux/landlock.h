/**
 * DOC: fs_access
 *
 * A set of actions on kernel objects may be defined by an attribute (e.g.
 * &struct landlock_path_beneath_attr) including a bitmask of access.
 *
 * Filesystem flags
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * These flags enable to restrict a sandboxed process to a set of actions on
 * files and directories.  Files or directories opened before the sandboxing
 * are not subject to these restrictions.
 *
 * A file can only receive these access rights:
 *
 * - %LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_EXECUTE: Execute a file.
 * - %LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_WRITE_FILE: Open a file with write access. Note that
 *   you might additionally need the %LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_TRUNCATE right in order
 *   to overwrite files with :manpage:`open(2)` using ``O_TRUNC`` or
 *   :manpage:`creat(2)`.
 * - %LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_READ_FILE: Open a file with read access.
 * - %LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_TRUNCATE: Truncate a file with :manpage:`truncate(2)`,
 *   :manpage:`ftruncate(2)`, :manpage:`creat(2)`, or :manpage:`open(2)` with
 *   ``O_TRUNC``. Whether an opened file can be truncated with
 *   :manpage:`ftruncate(2)` is determined during :manpage:`open(2)`, in the
 *   same way as read and write permissions are checked during
 *   :manpage:`open(2)` using %LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_READ_FILE and
 *   %LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_WRITE_FILE. This access right is available since the
 *   third version of the Landlock ABI.
 *
 * A directory can receive access rights related to files or directories.  The
 * following access right is applied to the directory itself, and the
 * directories beneath it:
 *
 * - %LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_READ_DIR: Open a directory or list its content.
 *
 * However, the following access rights only apply to the content of a
 * directory, not the directory itself:
 *
 * - %LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REMOVE_DIR: Remove an empty directory or rename one.
 * - %LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REMOVE_FILE: Unlink (or rename) a file.
 * - %LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_MAKE_CHAR: Create (or rename or link) a character
 *   device.
 * - %LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_MAKE_DIR: Create (or rename) a directory.
 * - %LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_MAKE_REG: Create (or rename or link) a regular file.
 * - %LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_MAKE_SOCK: Create (or rename or link) a UNIX domain
 *   socket.
 * - %LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_MAKE_FIFO: Create (or rename or link) a named pipe.
 * - %LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_MAKE_BLOCK: Create (or rename or link) a block device.
 * - %LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_MAKE_SYM: Create (or rename or link) a symbolic link.
 * - %LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REFER: Link or rename a file from or to a different
 *   directory (i.e. reparent a file hierarchy).  This access right is
 *   available since the second version of the Landlock ABI.  This is also the
 *   only access right which is always considered handled by any ruleset in
 *   such a way that reparenting a file hierarchy is always denied by default.
 *   To avoid privilege escalation, it is not enough to add a rule with this
 *   access right.  When linking or renaming a file, the destination directory
 *   hierarchy must also always have the same or a superset of restrictions of
 *   the source hierarchy.  If it is not the case, or if the domain doesn't
 *   handle this access right, such actions are denied by default with errno
 *   set to ``EXDEV``.  Linking also requires a ``LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_MAKE_*``
 *   access right on the destination directory, and renaming also requires a
 *   ``LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REMOVE_*`` access right on the source's (file or
 *   directory) parent.  Otherwise, such actions are denied with errno set to
 *   ``EACCES``.  The ``EACCES`` errno prevails over ``EXDEV`` to let user space
 *   efficiently deal with an unrecoverable error.
 *
 * .. warning::
 *
 *   It is currently not possible to restrict some file-related actions
 *   accessible through these syscall families: :manpage:`chdir(2)`,
 *   :manpage:`stat(2)`, :manpage:`flock(2)`, :manpage:`chmod(2)`,
 *   :manpage:`chown(2)`, :manpage:`setxattr(2)`, :manpage:`utime(2)`,
 *   :manpage:`ioctl(2)`, :manpage:`fcntl(2)`, :manpage:`access(2)`.
 *   Future Landlock evolutions will enable to restrict them.
