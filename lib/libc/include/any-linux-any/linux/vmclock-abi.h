/*
 * This structure provides a vDSO-style clock to VM guests, exposing the
 * relationship (or lack thereof) between the CPU clock (TSC, timebase, arch
 * counter, etc.) and real time. It is designed to address the problem of
 * live migration, which other clock enlightenments do not.
 *
 * When a guest is live migrated, this affects the clock in two ways.
 *
 * First, even between identical hosts the actual frequency of the underlying
 * counter will change within the tolerances of its specification (typically
 * Â±50PPM, or 4 seconds a day). This frequency also varies over time on the
 * same host, but can be tracked by NTP as it generally varies slowly. With
 * live migration there is a step change in the frequency, with no warning.
 *
 * Second, there may be a step change in the value of the counter itself, as
 * its accuracy is limited by the precision of the NTP synchronization on the
 * source and destination hosts.
 *
 * So any calibration (NTP, PTP, etc.) which the guest has done on the source
 * host before migration is invalid, and needs to be redone on the new host.
 *
 * In its most basic mode, this structure provides only an indication to the
 * guest that live migration has occurred. This allows the guest to know that
 * its clock is invalid and take remedial action. For applications that need
 * reliable accurate timestamps (e.g. distributed databases), the structure
 * can be mapped all the way to userspace. This allows the application to see
 * directly for itself that the clock is disrupted and take appropriate
 * action, even when using a vDSO-style method to get the time instead of a
 * system call.
 *
 * In its more advanced mode. this structure can also be used to expose the
 * precise relationship of the CPU counter to real time, as calibrated by the
 * host. This means that userspace applications can have accurate time
 * immediately after live migration, rather than having to pause operations
 * and wait for NTP to recover. This mode does, of course, rely on the
 * counter being reliable and consistent across CPUs.
 *
 * Note that this must be true UTC, never with smeared leap seconds. If a
 * guest wishes to construct a smeared clock, it can do so. Presenting a
 * smeared clock through this interface would be problematic because it
 * actually messes with the apparent counter *period*. A linear smearing
 * of 1 ms per second would effectively tweak the counter period by 1000PPM
 * at the start/end of the smearing period, while a sinusoidal smear would
 * basically be impossible to represent.
 *
 * This structure is offered with the intent that it be adopted into the
 * nascent virtio-rtc standard, as a virtio-rtc that does not address the live
 * migration problem seems a little less than fit for purpose. For that
 * reason, certain fields use precisely the same numeric definitions as in
 * the virtio-rtc proposal. The structure can also be exposed through an ACPI
 * device with the CID "VMCLOCK", modelled on the "VMGENID" device except for
 * the fact that it uses a real _CRS to convey the address of the structure
 * (which should be a full page, to allow for mapping directly to userspace).
