 * Arguments for how openat2(2) should open the target path. If only @flags and
 * @mode are non-zero, then openat2(2) operates very similarly to openat(2).
 *
 * However, unlike openat(2), unknown or invalid bits in @flags result in
 * -EINVAL rather than being silently ignored. @mode must be zero unless one of
 * {O_CREAT, O_TMPFILE} are set.
 *
 * @flags: O_* flags.
 * @mode: O_CREAT/O_TMPFILE file mode.
 * @resolve: RESOLVE_* flags.
