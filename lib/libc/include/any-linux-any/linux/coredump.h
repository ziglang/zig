 * to userspace how much data can be read. Userspace may use MSG_PEEK to
 * peek the size of struct coredump_req and then choose to consume it in
 * one go. Userspace may also simply read a COREDUMP_ACK_SIZE_VER0
 * request. If the size the kernel sends is larger userspace simply
 * discards any remaining data.
 *
 * The coredump_req->mask member is set to the currently know features.
 * Userspace may only set coredump_ack->mask to the bits raised by the
 * kernel in coredump_req->mask.
 *
 * The coredump_req->size_ack member is set by the kernel to the size of
 * struct coredump_ack the kernel knows. Userspace may only send up to
 * coredump_req->size_ack bytes to the kernel and must set
