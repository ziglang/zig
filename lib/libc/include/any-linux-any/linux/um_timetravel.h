 * DOC: Time travel shared memory overview
 *
 * The main purpose of the shared memory is to avoid all time travel message
 * that don't need any action, for example current time can be held in shared
 * memory without the need of any client to send a message UM_TIMETRAVEL_GET
 * in order to know what's the time.
 *
 * Since this is shared memory with all clients and controller and controller
 * creates the shared memory space, all time values are absolute to controller
 * time. So first time client connects to shared memory mode it should take the
 * current_time value in shared memory and keep it internally as a diff to
 * shared memory times, and once shared memory is initialized, any interaction
 * with the controller must happen in the controller time domain, including any
 * messages (for clients that are not using shared memory, the controller will
 * handle an offset and make the clients think they start at time zero.)
 *
 * Along with the shared memory file descriptor is sent to the client a logging
 * file descriptor, to have all logs related to shared memory,
 * logged into one place. note: to have all logs synced into log file at write,
 * file should be flushed (fflush) after writing to it.
 *
 * To avoid memory corruption, we define below for each field who can write to
 * it at what time, defined in the structure fields.
 *
 * To avoid having to pack this struct, all fields in it must be naturally aligned
 * (i.e. aligned to their size).
