 *      allocated by the user, via malloc (or similar). After allocating the
 *      CB, the user invokes - “memory ioctl” to map the user memory into a
 *      device virtual address. The user provides this address via the
 *      cb_handle field. The interface provides the ability to create a
 *      large CBs, Which aren’t limited to “HL_MAX_CB_SIZE”. Therefore, it
 *      increases the PCI-DMA queues throughput. This CB allocation method
 *      also reduces the use of Linux DMA-able memory pool. Which are limited
 *      and used by other Linux sub-systems.

/*
 * Command Submission
 *
 * To submit work to the device, the user need to call this IOCTL with a set
 * of JOBS. That set of JOBS constitutes a CS object.
 * Each JOB will be enqueued on a specific queue, according to the user's input.
 * There can be more then one JOB per queue.
 *
 * The CS IOCTL will receive two sets of JOBS. One set is for "restore" phase
 * and a second set is for "execution" phase.
 * The JOBS on the "restore" phase are enqueued only after context-switch
 * (or if its the first CS for this context). The user can also order the
 * driver to run the "restore" phase explicitly
 *
 * Goya/Gaudi:
 * There are two types of queues - external and internal. External queues
 * are DMA queues which transfer data from/to the Host. All other queues are
 * internal. The driver will get completion notifications from the device only
 * on JOBS which are enqueued in the external queues.
 *
 * Greco onwards:
 * There is a single type of queue for all types of engines, either DMA engines
 * for transfers from/to the host or inside the device, or compute engines.
 * The driver will get completion notifications from the device for all queues.
 *
 * For jobs on external queues, the user needs to create command buffers
 * through the CB ioctl and give the CB's handle to the CS ioctl. For jobs on
 * internal queues, the user needs to prepare a "command buffer" with packets
 * on either the device SRAM/DRAM or the host, and give the device address of
 * that buffer to the CS ioctl.
 * For jobs on H/W queues both options of command buffers are valid.
 *
 * This IOCTL is asynchronous in regard to the actual execution of the CS. This
 * means it returns immediately after ALL the JOBS were enqueued on their
 * relevant queues. Therefore, the user mustn't assume the CS has been completed
 * or has even started to execute.
 *
 * Upon successful enqueue, the IOCTL returns a sequence number which the user
 * can use with the "Wait for CS" IOCTL to check whether the handle's CS
 * non-internal JOBS have been completed. Note that if the CS has internal JOBS
 * which can execute AFTER the external JOBS have finished, the driver might
 * report that the CS has finished executing BEFORE the internal JOBS have
 * actually finished executing.
 *
 * Even though the sequence number increments per CS, the user can NOT
 * automatically assume that if CS with sequence number N finished, then CS
 * with sequence number N-1 also finished. The user can make this assumption if
 * and only if CS N and CS N-1 are exactly the same (same CBs for the same
 * queues).

/*
 * Wait for Command Submission
 *
 * The user can call this IOCTL with a handle it received from the CS IOCTL
 * to wait until the handle's CS has finished executing. The user will wait
 * inside the kernel until the CS has finished or until the user-requested
 * timeout has expired.
 *
 * If the timeout value is 0, the driver won't sleep at all. It will check
 * the status of the CS and return immediately
 *
 * The return value of the IOCTL is a standard Linux error code. The possible
 * values are:
 *
 * EINTR     - Kernel waiting has been interrupted, e.g. due to OS signal
 *             that the user process received
 * ETIMEDOUT - The CS has caused a timeout on the device
 * EIO       - The CS was aborted (usually because the device was reset)
 * ENODEV    - The device wants to do hard-reset (so user need to close FD)
 *
 * The driver also returns a custom define in case the IOCTL call returned 0.
 * The define can be one of the following:
 *
 * HL_WAIT_CS_STATUS_COMPLETED   - The CS has been completed successfully (0)
 * HL_WAIT_CS_STATUS_BUSY        - The CS is still executing (0)
 * HL_WAIT_CS_STATUS_TIMEDOUT    - The CS has caused a timeout on the device
 *                                 (ETIMEDOUT)
 * HL_WAIT_CS_STATUS_ABORTED     - The CS was aborted, usually because the
 *                                 device was reset (EIO)

 * Debug
 * - Enable/disable the ETR/ETF/FUNNEL/STM/BMON/SPMU debug traces
 *
 * This IOCTL allows the user to get debug traces from the chip.
 *
 * Before the user can send configuration requests of the various
 * debug/profile engines, it needs to set the device into debug mode.
 * This is because the debug/profile infrastructure is shared component in the
 * device and we can't allow multiple users to access it at the same time.
 *
 * Once a user set the device into debug mode, the driver won't allow other
 * users to "work" with the device, i.e. open a FD. If there are multiple users
 * opened on the device, the driver won't allow any user to debug the device.
 *
 * For each configuration request, the user needs to provide the register index
 * and essential data such as buffer address and size.
 *
 * Once the user has finished using the debug/profile engines, he should
 * set the device into non-debug mode, i.e. disable debug mode.
 *
 * The driver can decide to "kick out" the user if he abuses this interface.
