/*
 * UBI device creation (the same as MTD device attachment)
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * MTD devices may be attached using %UBI_IOCATT ioctl command of the UBI
 * control device. The caller has to properly fill and pass
 * &struct ubi_attach_req object - UBI will attach the MTD device specified in
 * the request and return the newly created UBI device number as the ioctl
 * return value.
 *
 * UBI device deletion (the same as MTD device detachment)
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * An UBI device maybe deleted with %UBI_IOCDET ioctl command of the UBI
 * control device.
 *
 * UBI volume creation
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * UBI volumes are created via the %UBI_IOCMKVOL ioctl command of UBI character
 * device. A &struct ubi_mkvol_req object has to be properly filled and a
 * pointer to it has to be passed to the ioctl.
 *
 * UBI volume deletion
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * To delete a volume, the %UBI_IOCRMVOL ioctl command of the UBI character
 * device should be used. A pointer to the 32-bit volume ID hast to be passed
 * to the ioctl.
 *
 * UBI volume re-size
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * To re-size a volume, the %UBI_IOCRSVOL ioctl command of the UBI character
 * device should be used. A &struct ubi_rsvol_req object has to be properly
 * filled and a pointer to it has to be passed to the ioctl.
 *
 * UBI volumes re-name
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * To re-name several volumes atomically at one go, the %UBI_IOCRNVOL command
 * of the UBI character device should be used. A &struct ubi_rnvol_req object
 * has to be properly filled and a pointer to it has to be passed to the ioctl.
 *
 * UBI volume update
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * Volume update should be done via the %UBI_IOCVOLUP ioctl command of the
 * corresponding UBI volume character device. A pointer to a 64-bit update
 * size should be passed to the ioctl. After this, UBI expects user to write
 * this number of bytes to the volume character device. The update is finished
 * when the claimed number of bytes is passed. So, the volume update sequence
 * is something like:
 *
 * fd = open("/dev/my_volume");
 * ioctl(fd, UBI_IOCVOLUP, &image_size);
 * write(fd, buf, image_size);
 * close(fd);
 *
 * Logical eraseblock erase
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * To erase a logical eraseblock, the %UBI_IOCEBER ioctl command of the
 * corresponding UBI volume character device should be used. This command
 * unmaps the requested logical eraseblock, makes sure the corresponding
 * physical eraseblock is successfully erased, and returns.
 *
 * Atomic logical eraseblock change
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * Atomic logical eraseblock change operation is called using the %UBI_IOCEBCH
 * ioctl command of the corresponding UBI volume character device. A pointer to
 * a &struct ubi_leb_change_req object has to be passed to the ioctl. Then the
 * user is expected to write the requested amount of bytes (similarly to what
 * should be done in case of the "volume update" ioctl).
 *
 * Logical eraseblock map
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * To map a logical eraseblock to a physical eraseblock, the %UBI_IOCEBMAP
 * ioctl command should be used. A pointer to a &struct ubi_map_req object is
 * expected to be passed. The ioctl maps the requested logical eraseblock to
 * a physical eraseblock and returns.  Only non-mapped logical eraseblocks can
 * be mapped. If the logical eraseblock specified in the request is already
 * mapped to a physical eraseblock, the ioctl fails and returns error.
 *
 * Logical eraseblock unmap
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * To unmap a logical eraseblock to a physical eraseblock, the %UBI_IOCEBUNMAP
 * ioctl command should be used. The ioctl unmaps the logical eraseblocks,
 * schedules corresponding physical eraseblock for erasure, and returns. Unlike
 * the "LEB erase" command, it does not wait for the physical eraseblock being
 * erased. Note, the side effect of this is that if an unclean reboot happens
 * after the unmap ioctl returns, you may find the LEB mapped again to the same
 * physical eraseblock after the UBI is run again.
 *
 * Check if logical eraseblock is mapped
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * To check if a logical eraseblock is mapped to a physical eraseblock, the
 * %UBI_IOCEBISMAP ioctl command should be used. It returns %0 if the LEB is
 * not mapped, and %1 if it is mapped.
 *
 * Set an UBI volume property
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * To set an UBI volume property the %UBI_IOCSETPROP ioctl command should be
 * used. A pointer to a &struct ubi_set_vol_prop_req object is expected to be
 * passed. The object describes which property should be set, and to which value
 * it should be set.
 *
 * Block devices on UBI volumes
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * To create a R/O block device on top of an UBI volume the %UBI_IOCVOLCRBLK
 * should be used. A pointer to a &struct ubi_blkcreate_req object is expected
 * to be passed, which is not used and reserved for future usage.
 *
 * Conversely, to remove a block device the %UBI_IOCVOLRMBLK should be used,
 * which takes no arguments.

 * @vid_hdr_offset: VID header offset (use defaults if %0)
 * @max_beb_per1024: maximum expected number of bad PEB per 1024 PEBs
 * @padding: reserved for future, not used, has to be zeroed
 * @disable_fm: whether disable fastmap
 *
 * This data structure is used to specify MTD device UBI has to attach and the
 * parameters it has to use. The number which should be assigned to the new UBI
 * device is passed in @ubi_num. UBI may automatically assign the number if
 * @UBI_DEV_NUM_AUTO is passed. In this case, the device number is returned in
 * @ubi_num.
 *
 * Most applications should pass %0 in @vid_hdr_offset to make UBI use default
 * offset of the VID header within physical eraseblocks. The default offset is
 * the next min. I/O unit after the EC header. For example, it will be offset
 * 512 in case of a 512 bytes page NAND flash with no sub-page support. Or
 * it will be 512 in case of a 2KiB page NAND flash with 4 512-byte sub-pages.
 *
 * But in rare cases, if this optimizes things, the VID header may be placed to
 * a different offset. For example, the boot-loader might do things faster if
 * the VID header sits at the end of the first 2KiB NAND page with 4 sub-pages.
 * As the boot-loader would not normally need to read EC headers (unless it
 * needs UBI in RW mode), it might be faster to calculate ECC. This is weird
 * example, but it real-life example. So, in this example, @vid_hdr_offer would
 * be 2KiB-64 bytes = 1984. Note, that this position is not even 512-bytes
 * aligned, which is OK, as UBI is clever enough to realize this is 4th
 * sub-page of the first page and add needed padding.
 *
 * The @max_beb_per1024 is the maximum amount of bad PEBs UBI expects on the
 * UBI device per 1024 eraseblocks.  This value is often given in an other form
 * in the NAND datasheet (min NVB i.e. minimal number of valid blocks). The
 * maximum expected bad eraseblocks per 1024 is then:
 *    1024 * (1 - MinNVB / MaxNVB)
 * Which gives 20 for most NAND devices.  This limit is used in order to derive
 * amount of eraseblock UBI reserves for handling new bad blocks. If the device
 * has more bad eraseblocks than this limit, UBI does not reserve any physical
 * eraseblocks for new bad eraseblocks, but attempts to use available
 * eraseblocks (if any). The accepted range is 0-768. If 0 is given, the
 * default kernel value of %CONFIG_MTD_UBI_BEB_LIMIT will be used.
 *
 * If @disable_fm is not zero, ubi doesn't create new fastmap even the module
 * param 'fm_autoconvert' is set, and existed old fastmap will be destroyed
 * after doing full scanning.
