   Each long double is made up of two IEEE doubles.  The value of the
   long double is the sum of the values of the two parts.  The most
   significant part is required to be the value of the long double
   rounded to the nearest double, as specified by IEEE.  For Inf
   values, the least significant part is required to be one of +0.0 or
   -0.0.  No other requirements are made; so, for example, 1.0 may be
   represented as (1.0, +0.0) or (1.0, -0.0), and the low part of a
   NaN is don't-care.  */
