 * address of the first quadword within the allocated (vmx_reserve) area.
 *
 * The pointer (v_regs) of vector type (elf_vrreg_t) is essentially
 * an array of 34 quadword entries.  The entries with
 * indexes 0-31 contain the corresponding vector registers.  The entry with
 * index 32 contains the vscr as the last word (offset 12) within the
 * quadword.  This allows the vscr to be stored as either a quadword (since
 * it must be copied via a vector register to/from storage) or as a word.
 * The entry with index 33 contains the vrsave as the first word (offset 0)
 * within the quadword.
