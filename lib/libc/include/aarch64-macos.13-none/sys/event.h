 * Filter specific flags for EVFILT_READ
 *
 * The default behavior for EVFILT_READ is to make the "read" determination
 * relative to the current file descriptor read pointer.
 *
 * The EV_POLL flag indicates the determination should be made via poll(2)
 * semantics. These semantics dictate always returning true for regular files,
 * regardless of the amount of unread data in the file.
 *
 * On input, EV_OOBAND specifies that filter should actively return in the
 * presence of OOB on the descriptor. It implies that filter will return
 * if there is OOB data available to read OR when any other condition
 * for the read are met (for example number of bytes regular data becomes >=
 * low-watermark).
 * If EV_OOBAND is not set on input, it implies that the filter should not actively
 * return for out of band data on the descriptor. The filter will then only return
 * when some other condition for read is met (ex: when number of regular data bytes
 * >=low-watermark OR when socket can't receive more data (SS_CANTRCVMORE)).
 *
 * On output, EV_OOBAND indicates the presence of OOB data on the descriptor.
 * If it was not specified as an input parameter, then the data count is the
 * number of bytes before the current OOB marker, else data count is the number
 * of bytes beyond OOB marker.

 * The presence of these flags directs the kevent64() call to attempt to receive
 * the message during kevent delivery, rather than just indicate that a message exists.
 * On setup, The ext[0] field contains the receive buffer pointer and ext[1] contains
 * the receive buffer length.  Upon event delivery, the actual received message size
 * is returned in ext[1].  As with mach_msg(), the buffer must be large enough to
 * receive the message and the requested (or default) message trailers.  In addition,
 * the fflags field contains the return code normally returned by mach_msg().
 *
 * If MACH_RCV_MSG is specified, and the ext[1] field specifies a zero length, the
 * system call argument specifying an ouput area (kevent_qos) will be consulted. If
 * the system call specified an output data area, the user-space address
 * of the received message is carved from that provided output data area (if enough
 * space remains there). The address and length of each received message is
 * returned in the ext[0] and ext[1] fields (respectively) of the corresponding kevent.
 *
 * IF_MACH_RCV_VOUCHER_CONTENT is specified, the contents of the message voucher is
 * extracted (as specified in the xflags field) and stored in ext[2] up to ext[3]
 * length.  If the input length is zero, and the system call provided a data area,
 * the space for the voucher content is carved from the provided space and its
 * address and length is returned in ext[2] and ext[3] respectively.
 *
 * If no message receipt options were provided in the fflags field on setup, no
 * message is received by this call. Instead, on output, the data field simply
 * contains the name of the actual port detected with a message waiting.
