 * The r_address is not really the address as it's name indicates but an offset.
 * In 4.3BSD a.out objects this offset is from the start of the "segment" for
 * which relocation entry is for (text or data).  For Mach-O object files it is
 * also an offset but from the start of the "section" for which the relocation
 * entry is for.  See comments in <mach-o/loader.h> about the r_address feild
 * in images for used with the dynamic linker.
 * 
 * In 4.3BSD a.out objects if r_extern is zero then r_symbolnum is an ordinal
 * for the segment the symbol being relocated is in.  These ordinals are the
 * symbol types N_TEXT, N_DATA, N_BSS or N_ABS.  In Mach-O object files these
 * ordinals refer to the sections in the object file in the order their section
 * structures appear in the headers of the object file they are in.  The first
 * section has the ordinal 1, the second 2, and so on.  This means that the
 * same ordinal in two different object files could refer to two different
 * sections.  And further could have still different ordinals when combined
 * by the link-editor.  The value R_ABS is used for relocation entries for
 * absolute symbols which need no further relocation.
 */

/*
 * For RISC machines some of the references are split across two instructions
 * and the instruction does not contain the complete value of the reference.
 * In these cases a second, or paired relocation entry, follows each of these
 * relocation entries, using a PAIR r_type, which contains the other part of the
 * reference not contained in the instruction.  This other part is stored in the
 * pair's r_address field.  The exact number of bits of the other part of the
 * reference store in the r_address field is dependent on the particular
 * relocation type for the particular architecture.

/*
 * To make scattered loading by the link editor work correctly "local"
 * relocation entries can't be used when the item to be relocated is the value
 * of a symbol plus an offset (where the resulting expresion is outside the
 * block the link editor is moving, a blocks are divided at symbol addresses).
 * In this case. where the item is a symbol value plus offset, the link editor
 * needs to know more than just the section the symbol was defined.  What is
 * needed is the actual value of the symbol without the offset so it can do the
 * relocation correctly based on where the value of the symbol got relocated to
 * not the value of the expression (with the offset added to the symbol value).
 * So for the NeXT 2.0 release no "local" relocation entries are ever used when
 * there is a non-zero offset added to a symbol.  The "external" and "local"
 * relocation entries remain unchanged.
 *
 * The implemention is quite messy given the compatibility with the existing
 * relocation entry format.  The ASSUMPTION is that a section will never be
 * bigger than 2**24 - 1 (0x00ffffff or 16,777,215) bytes.  This assumption
 * allows the r_address (which is really an offset) to fit in 24 bits and high
 * bit of the r_address field in the relocation_info structure to indicate
 * it is really a scattered_relocation_info structure.  Since these are only
 * used in places where "local" relocation entries are used and not where
 * "external" relocation entries are used the r_extern field has been removed.
 *
 * For scattered loading to work on a RISC machine where some of the references
 * are split across two instructions the link editor needs to be assured that
 * each reference has a unique 32 bit reference (that more than one reference is
 * NOT sharing the same high 16 bits for example) so it move each referenced
 * item independent of each other.  Some compilers guarantees this but the
 * compilers don't so scattered loading can be done on those that do guarantee
 * this.

 * Relocation types used in a generic implementation.  Relocation entries for

 * the difference of two symbols defined in different sections.  That is the
 * expression "symbol1 - symbol2 + constant" is a relocatable expression when
 * both symbols are defined in some section.  For this type of relocation the
 * both relocations entries are scattered relocation entries.  The value of
 * symbol1 is stored in the first relocation entry's r_value field and the
 * value of symbol2 is stored in the pair's r_value field.
 *
 * A special case for a prebound lazy pointer is needed to beable to set the
 * value of the lazy pointer back to its non-prebound state.  This is done
 * using the GENERIC_RELOC_PB_LA_PTR r_type.  This is a scattered relocation
 * entry where the r_value feild is the value of the lazy pointer not prebound.
