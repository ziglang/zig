 * Don't use va_list in the err/warn prototypes.   Va_list is typedef'd in two
 * places (<machine/varargs.h> and <machine/stdarg.h>), so if we include one
 * of them here we may collide with the utility's includes.  It's unreasonable
 * for utilities to have to include one of them to include err.h, so we get
 * __darwin_va_list from <machine/_type.h> and use it.
