 * Dispatch workloops invoke workitems submitted to them in priority order.
 *
 * @discussion
 * A dispatch workloop is a flavor of dispatch_queue_t that is a priority
 * ordered queue (using the QOS class of the submitted workitems as the
 * ordering).
 *
 * Between each workitem invocation, the workloop will evaluate whether higher
 * priority workitems have since been submitted, either directly to the
 * workloop or to any queues that target the workloop, and execute these first.
 *
 * Serial queues targeting a workloop maintain FIFO execution of their
 * workitems. However, the workloop may reorder workitems submitted to
 * independent serial queues targeting it with respect to each other,
 * based on their priorities, while preserving FIFO execution with respect to
 * each serial queue.
 *
 * A dispatch workloop is a "subclass" of dispatch_queue_t which can be passed
 * to all APIs accepting a dispatch queue, except for functions from the
 * dispatch_sync() family. dispatch_async_and_wait() must be used for workloop
 * objects. Functions from the dispatch_sync() family on queues targeting
 * a workloop are still permitted but discouraged for performance reasons.
