   The new priority levels are:
     Rx = 31 (very low)
     Rx = 5 (medium high)
   Any program can set the priority to very low, low, medium low, and medium,
   as these are unprivileged.
   The medium high priority, on the other hand, is privileged, and may only be
   set during certain time intervals by problem-state programs.  If the program
   priority is medium high when the time interval expires or if an attempt is
   made to set the priority to medium high when it is not allowed, the PRI
   field is set to medium.
