/* The type of the 'argv' argument to getopt_long and getopt_long_only
   is properly 'char **', since both functions may write to the array
   (in order to move all the options to the beginning).  However, for
   compatibility with old versions of LSB, glibc has to use 'char *const *'
   instead.  */
