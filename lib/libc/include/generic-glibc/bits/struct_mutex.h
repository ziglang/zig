  /* KIND must stay at this position in the structure to maintain
     binary compatibility with static initializers.

     Concurrency notes:
     The __kind of a mutex is initialized either by the static
     PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER or by a call to pthread_mutex_init.

     After a mutex has been initialized, the __kind of a mutex is usually not
     changed.  BUT it can be set to -1 in pthread_mutex_destroy or elision can
     be enabled.  This is done concurrently in the pthread_mutex_*lock
     functions by using the macro FORCE_ELISION. This macro is only defined
     for architectures which supports lock elision.

     For elision, there are the flags PTHREAD_MUTEX_ELISION_NP and
     PTHREAD_MUTEX_NO_ELISION_NP which can be set in addition to the already
     set type of a mutex.  Before a mutex is initialized, only
     PTHREAD_MUTEX_NO_ELISION_NP can be set with pthread_mutexattr_settype.

     After a mutex has been initialized, the functions pthread_mutex_*lock can
     enable elision - if the mutex-type and the machine supports it - by
     setting the flag PTHREAD_MUTEX_ELISION_NP. This is done concurrently.
     Afterwards the lock / unlock functions are using specific elision
     code-paths.  */
