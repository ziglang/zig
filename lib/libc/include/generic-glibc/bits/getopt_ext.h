/* This header should not be used directly; include getopt.h instead.
   Unlike most bits headers, it does not have a protective #error,
   because the guard macro for getopt.h in gnulib is not fixed.  */

/* Describe the long-named options requested by the application.
   The LONG_OPTIONS argument to getopt_long or getopt_long_only is a vector
   of 'struct option' terminated by an element containing a name which is
   zero.

   The field 'has_arg' is:
   no_argument		(or 0) if the option does not take an argument,
   required_argument	(or 1) if the option requires an argument,
   optional_argument 	(or 2) if the option takes an optional argument.

   If the field 'flag' is not NULL, it points to a variable that is set
   to the value given in the field 'val' when the option is found, but
   left unchanged if the option is not found.

   To have a long-named option do something other than set an 'int' to
   a compiled-in constant, such as set a value from 'optarg', set the
   option's 'flag' field to zero and its 'val' field to a nonzero
   value (the equivalent single-letter option character, if there is
   one).  For long options that have a zero 'flag' field, 'getopt'
   returns the contents of the 'val' field.  */
