/* Data structure used to pass permission information to IPC operations.
   It follows the kernel ipc64_perm size so the syscall can be made directly
   without temporary buffer copy.  However, since glibc defines the MODE
   field as mode_t per POSIX definition (BZ#18231), it omits the __PAD1 field
   (since glibc does not export mode_t as 16-bit for any architecture).  */
