/*
 * Allocation dependencies are handled with undo/redo on the in-memory
 * copy of the data. A particular data dependency is eliminated when
 * it is ALLCOMPLETE: that is ATTACHED, DEPCOMPLETE, and COMPLETE.
 * 
 * The ATTACHED flag means that the data is not currently being written
 * to disk.
 * 
 * The UNDONE flag means that the data has been rolled back to a safe
 * state for writing to the disk. When the I/O completes, the data is
 * restored to its current form and the state reverts to ATTACHED.
 * The data must be locked throughout the rollback, I/O, and roll
 * forward so that the rolled back information is never visible to
 * user processes.
 *
 * The COMPLETE flag indicates that the item has been written. For example,
 * a dependency that requires that an inode be written will be marked
 * COMPLETE after the inode has been written to disk.
 * 
 * The DEPCOMPLETE flag indicates the completion of any other
 * dependencies such as the writing of a cylinder group map has been
 * completed. A dependency structure may be freed only when both it
 * and its dependencies have completed and any rollbacks that are in
 * progress have finished as indicated by the set of ALLCOMPLETE flags
 * all being set.
 * 
 * The two MKDIR flags indicate additional dependencies that must be done
 * when creating a new directory. MKDIR_BODY is cleared when the directory
 * data block containing the "." and ".." entries has been written.
 * MKDIR_PARENT is cleared when the parent inode with the increased link
 * count for ".." has been written. When both MKDIR flags have been
 * cleared, the DEPCOMPLETE flag is set to indicate that the directory
 * dependencies have been completed. The writing of the directory inode
 * itself sets the COMPLETE flag which then allows the directory entry for
 * the new directory to be written to disk. The RMDIR flag marks a dirrem
 * structure as representing the removal of a directory rather than a
 * file. When the removal dependencies are completed, additional work needs
 * to be done* (an additional decrement of the associated inode, and a
 * decrement of the parent inode).
 *
 * The DIRCHG flag marks a diradd structure as representing the changing
 * of an existing entry rather than the addition of a new one. When
 * the update is complete the dirrem associated with the inode for
 * the old name must be added to the worklist to do the necessary
 * reference count decrement.
 * 
 * The GOINGAWAY flag indicates that the data structure is frozen from
 * further change until its dependencies have been completed and its
 * resources freed after which it will be discarded.
 *
 * The IOSTARTED flag prevents multiple calls to the I/O start routine from
 * doing multiple rollbacks.
 *
 * The NEWBLOCK flag marks pagedep structures that have just been allocated,
 * so must be claimed by the inode before all dependencies are complete.
 *
 * The INPROGRESS flag marks worklist structures that are still on the
 * worklist, but are being considered for action by some process.
 *
 * The UFS1FMT flag indicates that the inode being processed is a ufs1 format.
 *
 * The EXTDATA flag indicates that the allocdirect describes an
 * extended-attributes dependency.
 *
 * The ONWORKLIST flag shows whether the structure is currently linked
 * onto a worklist.
 *
 * The UNLINK* flags track the progress of updating the on-disk linked
 * list of active but unlinked inodes. When an inode is first unlinked
 * it is marked as UNLINKED. When its on-disk di_freelink has been
 * written its UNLINKNEXT flags is set. When its predecessor in the
 * list has its di_freelink pointing at us its UNLINKPREV is set.
 * When the on-disk list can reach it from the superblock, its
 * UNLINKONLIST flag is set. Once all of these flags are set, it
 * is safe to let its last name be removed.

/*
 * The "inodedep" structure tracks the set of dependencies associated
 * with an inode. One task that it must manage is delayed operations
 * (i.e., work requests that must be held until the inodedep's associated
 * inode has been written to disk). Getting an inode from its incore 
 * state to the disk requires two steps to be taken by the filesystem
 * in this order: first the inode must be copied to its disk buffer by
 * the VOP_UPDATE operation; second the inode's buffer must be written
 * to disk. To ensure that both operations have happened in the required
 * order, the inodedep maintains two lists. Delayed operations are
 * placed on the id_inowait list. When the VOP_UPDATE is done, all
 * operations on the id_inowait list are moved to the id_bufwait list.
 * When the buffer is written, the items on the id_bufwait list can be
 * safely moved to the work queue to be processed. A second task of the
 * inodedep structure is to track the status of block allocation within
 * the inode.  Each block that is allocated is represented by an
 * "allocdirect" structure (see below). It is linked onto the id_newinoupdt
 * list until both its contents and its allocation in the cylinder
 * group map have been written to disk. Once these dependencies have been
 * satisfied, it is removed from the id_newinoupdt list and any followup
 * actions such as releasing the previous block or fragment are placed
 * on the id_inowait list. When an inode is updated (a VOP_UPDATE is
 * done), the "inodedep" structure is linked onto the buffer through
 * its worklist. Thus, it will be notified when the buffer is about
 * to be written and when it is done. At the update time, all the
 * elements on the id_newinoupdt list are moved to the id_inoupdt list
 * since those changes are now relevant to the copy of the inode in the
 * buffer. Also at update time, the tasks on the id_inowait list are
 * moved to the id_bufwait list so that they will be executed when
 * the updated inode has been written to disk. When the buffer containing
 * the inode is written to disk, any updates listed on the id_inoupdt
 * list are rolled back as they are not yet safe. Following the write,
 * the changes are once again rolled forward and any actions on the
 * id_bufwait list are processed (since those actions are now safe).
 * The entries on the id_inoupdt and id_newinoupdt lists must be kept
 * sorted by logical block number to speed the calculation of the size
 * of the rolled back inode (see explanation in initiate_write_inodeblock).
 * When a directory entry is created, it is represented by a diradd.
 * The diradd is added to the id_inowait list as it cannot be safely
 * written to disk until the inode that it represents is on disk. After
 * the inode is written, the id_bufwait list is processed and the diradd
 * entries are moved to the id_pendinghd list where they remain until
 * the directory block containing the name has been written to disk.
 * The purpose of keeping the entries on the id_pendinghd list is so that
 * the softdep_fsync function can find and push the inode's directory
 * name(s) as part of the fsync operation for that file.

 * are resolved the DEPCOMPLETE flag is set in the diradd structure.

 * These additional dependencies are tracked by two mkdir structures that
