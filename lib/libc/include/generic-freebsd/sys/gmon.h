/*
 * Fraction of text space to allocate for from hash buckets.
 * The value of HASHFRACTION is based on the minimum number of bytes
 * of separation between two subroutine call points in the object code.
 * Given MIN_SUBR_SEPARATION bytes of separation the value of
 * HASHFRACTION is calculated as:
 *
 *	HASHFRACTION = MIN_SUBR_SEPARATION / (2 * sizeof(short) - 1);
 *
 * For example, on the VAX, the shortest two call sequence is:
 *
 *	calls	$0,(r0)
 *	calls	$0,(r0)
 *
 * which is separated by only three bytes, thus HASHFRACTION is
 * calculated as:
 *
 *	HASHFRACTION = 3 / (2 * 2 - 1) = 1
 *
 * Note that the division above rounds down, thus if MIN_SUBR_FRACTION
 * is less than three, this algorithm will not work!
 *
 * In practice, however, call instructions are rarely at a minimal
 * distance.  Hence, we will define HASHFRACTION to be 2 across all
 * architectures.  This saves a reasonable amount of space for
 * profiling data structures without (in practice) sacrificing
 * any granularity.

 * different values.  Since the hash is essentially division by
 * sizeof(unsigned short), the correct formula is:
 *
 * 	HASHFRACTION = MIN_FUNCTION_ALIGNMENT / sizeof(unsigned short)
 *
 * Note that he unsigned short here has nothing to do with the one for
 * HISTFRACTION.
 *
 * Hash collisions from a two call sequence don't matter.  They get
 * handled like collisions for calls to different addresses from the
 * same address through a function pointer.
