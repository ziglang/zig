/*
 * Implements bitmap resource lists.
 *
 *	Usage:
 *		blist = blist_create(blocks, flags)
 *		(void)  blist_destroy(blist)
 *		blkno = blist_alloc(blist, &count, maxcount)
 *		(void)  blist_free(blist, blkno, count)
 *		nblks = blist_fill(blist, blkno, count)
 *		(void)  blist_resize(&blist, count, freeextra, flags)
 *		
 *
 *	Notes:
 *		on creation, the entire list is marked reserved.  You should
 *		first blist_free() the sections you want to make available
 *		for allocation before doing general blist_alloc()/free()
 *		ops.
 *
 *		SWAPBLK_NONE is returned on failure.  This module is typically
 *		capable of managing up to (2^63) blocks per blist, though
 *		the memory utilization would be insane if you actually did
 *		that.  Managing something like 512MB worth of 4K blocks 
 *		eats around 32 KBytes of memory.
