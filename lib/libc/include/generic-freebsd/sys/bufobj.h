/*
 * Architectural notes:
 *
 * bufobj is a new object which is what buffers hang from in the buffer
 * cache.
 *
 * This used to be vnodes, but we need non-vnode code to be able
 * to use the buffer cache as well, specifically geom classes like gbde,
 * raid3 and raid5.
 *
 * All vnodes will contain a bufobj initially, but down the road we may
 * want to only allocate bufobjs when they are needed.  There could be a
 * large number of vnodes in the system which wouldn't need a bufobj during
 * their lifetime.
 *
 * The exact relationship to the vmobject is not determined at this point,
 * it may in fact be that we find them to be two sides of the same object 
 * once things starts to crystalize.
