/*
 * Describe an interrupt event.  An event holds a list of handlers.
 * The 'pre_ithread', 'post_ithread', 'post_filter', and 'assign_cpu'
 * hooks are used to invoke MD code for certain operations.
 *
 * The 'pre_ithread' hook is called when an interrupt thread for
 * handlers without filters is scheduled.  It is responsible for
 * ensuring that 1) the system won't be swamped with an interrupt
 * storm from the associated source while the ithread runs and 2) the
 * current CPU is able to receive interrupts from other interrupt
 * sources.  The first is usually accomplished by disabling
 * level-triggered interrupts until the ithread completes.  The second
 * is accomplished on some platforms by acknowledging the interrupt
 * via an EOI.
 *
 * The 'post_ithread' hook is invoked when an ithread finishes.  It is
 * responsible for ensuring that the associated interrupt source will
 * trigger an interrupt when it is asserted in the future.  Usually
 * this is implemented by enabling a level-triggered interrupt that
 * was previously disabled via the 'pre_ithread' hook.
 *
 * The 'post_filter' hook is invoked when a filter handles an
 * interrupt.  It is responsible for ensuring that the current CPU is
 * able to receive interrupts again.  On some platforms this is done
 * by acknowledging the interrupts via an EOI.
 *
 * The 'assign_cpu' hook is used to bind an interrupt source to a
 * specific CPU.  If the interrupt cannot be bound, this function may
 * return an error.
 *
 * Note that device drivers may also use interrupt events to manage
 * multiplexing interrupt interrupt handler into handlers for child
 * devices.  In that case, the above hooks are not used.  The device
 * can create an event for its interrupt resource and register child
 * event handlers with that event.  It can then use
 * intr_event_execute_handlers() to execute non-filter handlers.
 * Currently filter handlers are not supported by this, but that can
 * be added by splitting out the filter loop from intr_event_handle()
 * if desired.
