 * Create an allocator that manages a pool of DMA buffers.
 *
 * The allocator manages a collection of uma(9) zones of buffers in power-of-two
 * sized increments ranging from minimum_alignment to the platform's PAGE_SIZE.
 * The buffers within each zone are aligned on boundaries corresponding to the
 * buffer size, and thus by implication each buffer is contiguous within a page
 * and does not cross a power of two boundary larger than the buffer size.
 * These rules are intended to make it easy for a busdma implementation to
 * check whether a tag's constraints allow use of a buffer from the allocator.
 *
 * minimum_alignment is also the minimum buffer allocation size.  For platforms
 * with software-assisted cache coherency, this is typically the data cache line
 * size (and MUST not be smaller than the cache line size).
 *
 * name appears in zone stats as 'dma name nnnnn' where 'dma' is fixed and
 * 'nnnnn' is the size of buffers in that zone.
 *
 * If the alloc/free function pointers are NULL, the regular uma internal
 * allocators are used (I.E., you get "plain old kernel memory").  On a platform
 * with an exclusion zone that applies to all DMA operations, a custom allocator
 * could be used to ensure no buffer memory is ever allocated from that zone,
 * allowing the bus_dmamem_alloc() implementation to make the assumption that
 * buffers provided by the allocation could never lead to the need for a bounce.
