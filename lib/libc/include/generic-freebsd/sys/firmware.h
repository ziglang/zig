/*
 * Loadable firmware support.
 *
 * The firmware abstraction provides an interface for loading firmware
 * images into the kernel and making them available to clients.
 *
 * Firmware images are usually embedded in kernel loadable modules that can
 * be loaded on-demand or pre-loaded as desired.  Modules may contain
 * one or more firmware images that are stored as opaque data arrays
 * and registered with a unique string name. Clients request
 * firmware by name, and are returned a struct firmware * below on success.
 * The kernel keeps track of references to firmware images to allow/prevent
 * module/data unload.
 *
 * When multiple images are stored in one module, the first image is
 * treated as the master with the other images holding references
 * to it.  This means that to unload the module each dependent/subimage
 * must first have its references removed.
 * In order for automatic loading to work, the master image must have
 * the same name as the module it is embedded into.
