 * Filesystem private node structures should include space for a
 * pointer to a struct lockf_state. This pointer is used by the lock
 * manager to track the locking state for a file.
 *
 * The ls_active list contains the set of active locks on the file. It
 * is strictly ordered by the lock's lf_start value. Each active lock
 * will have in-coming edges to any pending lock which it blocks.
 *
 * Lock requests which are blocked by some other active lock are
 * listed in ls_pending with newer requests first in the list. Lock
 * requests in this list will have out-going edges to each active lock
 * that blocks then. They will also have out-going edges to each
 * pending lock that is older in the queue - this helps to ensure
 * fairness when several processes are contenting to lock the same
 * record.

 * The value of ls_threads is the number of threads currently using
 * the state structure (typically either setting/clearing locks or
 * sleeping waiting to do so). This is used to defer freeing the
 * structure while some thread is still using it.
