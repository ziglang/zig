 * it on the kernel directly.  Changes to PSL_AC are silently ignored on
 * 386's.
 *
 * Users are allowed to change the privileged flag PSL_RF.  The cpu sets PSL_RF
 * in tf_eflags for faults.  Debuggers should sometimes set it there too.
 * tf_eflags is kept in the signal context during signal handling and there is
 * no other place to remember it, so the PSL_RF bit may be corrupted by the
 * signal handler without us knowing.  Corruption of the PSL_RF bit at worst
 * causes one more or one less debugger trap, so allowing it is fairly
 * harmless.
