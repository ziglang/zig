 * The key should have odd parity in the low bit of each byte.
 * ivec is the input vector, and is updated to the new one (cbc only).
 * The mode is created by oring together the appropriate parameters.
 * DESERR_NOHWDEVICE is returned if DES_HW was specified but
 * there was no hardware to do it on (the data will still be
