 *	success = pmap_unset(program, version);
 *	port = pmap_getport(address, program, version, protocol);
 *	head = pmap_getmaps(address);

 *		xdrargs, argsp, xdrres, resp, tout, port_ptr)
 *		(works for udp only.)
 * 	clnt_stat = clnt_broadcast(program, version, procedure,
 *		xdrargs, argsp,	xdrres, resp, eachresult)
 *		(like pmap_rmtcall, except the call is broadcasted to all
 *		locally connected nets.  For each valid response received,
 *		the procedure eachresult is called.  Its form is:
 *	done = eachresult(resp, raddr)
 *		bool_t done;
 *		caddr_t resp;
 *		struct sockaddr_in raddr;
 *		where resp points to the results of the call and raddr is the
 *		address if the responder to the broadcast.
