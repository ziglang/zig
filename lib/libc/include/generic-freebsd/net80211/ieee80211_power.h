 * Power save packet queues.  There are two queues, one
 * for frames coming from the net80211 layer and the other
 * for frames that come from the driver. Frames from the
 * driver are expected to have M_ENCAP marked to indicate
 * they have already been encapsulated and are treated as
 * higher priority: they are sent first when flushing the
 * queue on a power save state change or in response to a
 * ps-poll frame.
 *
 * Note that frames sent from the high priority queue are
 * fed directly to the driver without going through
 * ieee80211_start again; drivers that send up encap'd
 * frames are required to handle them when they come back.
