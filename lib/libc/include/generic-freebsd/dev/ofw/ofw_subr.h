/*
 * Translate an address from the Nth tuple of a device node's reg properties to
 * a physical memory address, by applying the range mappings from all ancestors.
 * This assumes that all ancestor ranges are simple numerical offsets for which
 * addition and subtraction operations will perform the required mapping (the
 * bit-options in the high word of standard PCI properties are also handled).
 * After the call, *pci_hi (if non-NULL) contains the phys.hi cell of the
 * device's parent PCI bus, or OFW_PADDR_NOT_PCI if no PCI bus is involved.
 *
 * This is intended to be a helper function called by the platform-specific
 * implementation of OF_decode_addr(), and not for direct use by device drivers.
