/*
 *
 * ioctl names and related fields
 *
 * NIOCTXSYNC, NIOCRXSYNC synchronize tx or rx queues,
 *	whose identity is set in NIOCREGIF through nr_ringid.
 *	These are non blocking and take no argument.
 *
 * NIOCGINFO takes a struct ifreq, the interface name is the input,
 *	the outputs are number of queues and number of descriptor
 *	for each queue (useful to set number of threads etc.).
 *	The info returned is only advisory and may change before
 *	the interface is bound to a file descriptor.
 *
 * NIOCREGIF takes an interface name within a struct nmre,
 *	and activates netmap mode on the interface (if possible).
 *
 * The argument to NIOCGINFO/NIOCREGIF overlays struct ifreq so we
 * can pass it down to other NIC-related ioctls.
 *
 * The actual argument (struct nmreq) has a number of options to request
 * different functions.
 * The following are used in NIOCREGIF when nr_cmd == 0:
 *
 * nr_name	(in)
 *	The name of the port (em0, valeXXX:YYY, etc.)
 *	limited to IFNAMSIZ for backward compatibility.
 *
 * nr_version	(in/out)
 *	Must match NETMAP_API as used in the kernel, error otherwise.
 *	Always returns the desired value on output.
 *
 * nr_tx_slots, nr_tx_slots, nr_tx_rings, nr_rx_rings (in/out)
 *	On input, non-zero values may be used to reconfigure the port
 *	according to the requested values, but this is not guaranteed.
 *	On output the actual values in use are reported.
 *
 * nr_ringid (in)
 *	Indicates how rings should be bound to the file descriptors.
 *	If nr_flags != 0, then the low bits (in NETMAP_RING_MASK)
 *	are used to indicate the ring number, and nr_flags specifies
 *	the actual rings to bind. NETMAP_NO_TX_POLL is unaffected.
 *
 *	NOTE: THE FOLLOWING (nr_flags == 0) IS DEPRECATED:
 *	If nr_flags == 0, NETMAP_HW_RING and NETMAP_SW_RING control
 *	the binding as follows:
 *	0 (default)			binds all physical rings
 *	NETMAP_HW_RING | ring number	binds a single ring pair
 *	NETMAP_SW_RING			binds only the host tx/rx rings
 *
 *	NETMAP_NO_TX_POLL can be OR-ed to make select()/poll() push
 *		packets on tx rings only if POLLOUT is set.
 *		The default is to push any pending packet.
 *
 *	NETMAP_DO_RX_POLL can be OR-ed to make select()/poll() release
 *		packets on rx rings also when POLLIN is NOT set.
 *		The default is to touch the rx ring only with POLLIN.
 *		Note that this is the opposite of TX because it
 *		reflects the common usage.
 *
 *	NOTE: NETMAP_PRIV_MEM IS DEPRECATED, use nr_arg2 instead.
 *	NETMAP_PRIV_MEM is set on return for ports that do not use
 *		the global memory allocator.
 *		This information is not significant and applications
 *		should look at the region id in nr_arg2
 *
 * nr_flags	is the recommended mode to indicate which rings should
 *		be bound to a file descriptor. Values are NR_REG_*
 *
 * nr_arg1 (in)	Reserved.
 *
 * nr_arg2 (in/out) The identity of the memory region used.
 *		On input, 0 means the system decides autonomously,
 *		other values may try to select a specific region.
 *		On return the actual value is reported.
 *		Region '1' is the global allocator, normally shared
 *		by all interfaces. Other values are private regions.
 *		If two ports the same region zero-copy is possible.
 *
 * nr_arg3 (in/out)	number of extra buffers to be allocated.
 *
 *
 *
 * nr_cmd (in)	if non-zero indicates a special command:
 *	NETMAP_BDG_ATTACH	 and nr_name = vale*:ifname
 *		attaches the NIC to the switch; nr_ringid specifies
 *		which rings to use. Used by valectl -a ...
 *	    nr_arg1 = NETMAP_BDG_HOST also attaches the host port
 *		as in valectl -h ...
 *
 *	NETMAP_BDG_DETACH	and nr_name = vale*:ifname
 *		disconnects a previously attached NIC.
 *		Used by valectl -d ...
 *
 *	NETMAP_BDG_LIST
 *		list the configuration of VALE switches.
 *
 *	NETMAP_BDG_VNET_HDR
 *		Set the virtio-net header length used by the client
 *		of a VALE switch port.
 *
 *	NETMAP_BDG_NEWIF
 *		create a persistent VALE port with name nr_name.
 *		Used by valectl -n ...
 *
 *	NETMAP_BDG_DELIF
 *		delete a persistent VALE port. Used by valectl -d ...
 *
 * nr_arg1, nr_arg2, nr_arg3  (in/out)		command specific
 *
