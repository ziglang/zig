/* 
 * OUIs are most often used to uniquely identify network interfaces
 * and occupy the first 3 bytes of both destination and source MAC
 * addresses.  The following allocations exist so that various
 * software systems associated with FreeBSD can have unique IDs in the
 * absence of hardware.  The use of OUIs for this purpose is not fully
 * fleshed out but is now in common use in virtualization technology.
 * 
 * Allocations from this range are expected to be made using COMMON
 * SENSE by developers.  Do NOT take a large range just because
 * they're currently wide open.  Take the smallest useful range for
 * your system.  We have (2^24 - 2) available addresses (see Reserved
 * Values below) but that is far from infinite.
 *
 * In the event of a conflict arbitration of allocation in this file
 * is subject to core@ approval.
 * 
 * Applications are differentiated based on the high order bit(s) of
 * the remaining three bytes.  Our first allocation has all 0s, the
 * next allocation has the highest bit set.  Allocating in this way
 * gives us 254 allocations of 64K addresses.  Address blocks can be
 * concatenated if necessary.
 *
 * Reserved Values: 0x000000 and 0xffffff are reserved and MUST NOT BE
 * allocated for any reason.
