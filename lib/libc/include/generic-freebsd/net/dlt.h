 * NetBSD uses 15 for HIPPI.

 * From a quick look at sys/net/if_hippi.h and sys/net/if_hippisubr.c
 * in an older version of NetBSD , the header appears to be:
 *
 * 	a 1-byte ULP field (ULP-id)?
 *
 *	a 1-byte flags field;
 *
 *	a 2-byte "offsets" field;
 *
 *	a 4-byte "D2 length" field (D2_Size?);
 *
 *	a 4-byte "destination switch" field (or a 1-byte field
 *	containing the Forwarding Class, Double_Wide, and Message_Type
 *	sub fields, followed by a 3-byte Destination_Switch_Address
 *	field?, HIPPI-LE 3.4-style?);
 *
 *	a 4-byte "source switch" field (or a 1-byte field containing the
 *	Destination_Address_type and Source_Address_Type fields, followed
 *	by a 3-byte Source_Switch_Address field, HIPPI-LE 3.4-style?);
 *
 *	a 2-byte reserved field;
 *
 *	a 6-byte destination address field;
 *
 *	a 2-byte "local admin" field;
 *
 *	a 6-byte source address field;
 *
 * followed by an 802.2 LLC header.
 *
 * This looks somewhat like something derived from the HIPPI-FP 4.4
 * Header_Area, followed an HIPPI-FP 4.4 D1_Area containing a D1 data set
 * with the header in HIPPI-LE 3.4 (ANSI X3.218-1993), followed by an
 * HIPPI-FP 4.4 D2_Area (with no Offset) containing the 802.2 LLC header
 * and payload?  Or does the "offsets" field contain the D2_Offset,
 * with that many bytes of offset before the payload?
 *
 * See http://wotug.org/parallel/standards/hippi/ for an archive of
 * HIPPI specifications.
 *
 * RFC 2067 imposes some additional restrictions.  It says that the
 * Offset is always zero
 *
 * HIPPI is long-gone, and the source files found in an older version
 * of NetBSD don't appear to be in the main CVS branch, so we may never
 * see a capture with this link-layer type.

 * 121 was reserved for Siemens HiPath HDLC on 2002-01-25, as

 *
 * On 2004-02-25, a FreeBSD checkin to sys/net/bpf.h was made that
 * assigned 121 as DLT_PFSYNC.  In current versions, its libpcap
 * does DLT_ <-> LINKTYPE_ mapping, mapping DLT_PFSYNC to a
 * LINKTYPE_PFSYNC value of 246, so it should write out DLT_PFSYNC
 * dump files with 246 as the link-layer header type.  (Earlier
 * versions might not have done mapping, in which case they would
 * have written them out with a link-layer header type of 121.)
 *
 * OpenBSD, from which pf came, however, uses 18 for DLT_PFSYNC;
 * its libpcap does no DLT_ <-> LINKTYPE_ mapping, so it would
 * write out DLT_PFSYNC dump files with use 18 as the link-layer
 * header type.
 *
 * NetBSD, DragonFly BSD, and Darwin also use 18 for DLT_PFSYNC; in
 * current versions, their libpcaps do DLT_ <-> LINKTYPE_ mapping,
 * mapping DLT_PFSYNC to a LINKTYPE_PFSYNC value of 246, so they
 * should write out DLT_PFSYNC dump files with 246 as the link-layer
 * header type.  (Earlier versions might not have done mapping,
 * in which case they'd work the same way OpenBSD does, writing
 * them out with a link-layer header type of 18.)
 *
 * We'll define DLT_PFSYNC as:
 *
 *    18 on NetBSD, OpenBSD, DragonFly BSD, and Darwin;
 *
 *    121 on FreeBSD;
 *
 *    246 everywhere else.
 *
 * We'll define DLT_HHDLC as 121 on everything except for FreeBSD;
 * anybody who wants to compile, on FreeBSD, code that uses DLT_HHDLC
 * is out of luck.
 *
 * We'll define LINKTYPE_PFSYNC as 246 on *all* platforms, so that
 * savefiles written using *this* code won't use 18 or 121 for PFSYNC,
 * they'll all use 246.
 *
 * Code that uses pcap_datalink() to determine the link-layer header
 * type of a savefile won't, when built and run on FreeBSD, be able
 * to distinguish between LINKTYPE_PFSYNC and LINKTYPE_HHDLC capture
 * files, as pcap_datalink() will give 121 for both of them.  Code
 * that doesn't, such as the code in Wireshark, will be able to
 * distinguish between them.
 *
 * FreeBSD's libpcap won't map a link-layer header type of 18 - i.e.,
 * DLT_PFSYNC files from OpenBSD and possibly older versions of NetBSD,
 * DragonFly BSD, and macOS - to DLT_PFSYNC, so code built with FreeBSD's
 * libpcap won't treat those files as DLT_PFSYNC files.
 *
 * Other libpcaps won't map a link-layer header type of 121 to DLT_PFSYNC;
 * this means they can read DLT_HHDLC files, if any exist, but won't
 * treat pcap files written by any older versions of FreeBSD libpcap that
 * didn't map to 246 as DLT_PFSYNC files.

 * Sadly, the folks at Apple either had no clue that the DLT_USERn values

 * didn't know that the right way to get a link-layer header type is to
 * ask tcpdump.org for one, or knew and didn't care, so they just
 * used DLT_USER2, which causes problems for everything except for
 * their version of tcpdump.
 *
 * So I'll just give them one; hopefully this will show up in a
 * libpcap release in time for them to get this into 10.10 Big Sur
 * or whatever Mavericks' successor is called.  LINKTYPE_PKTAP
 * will be 258 *even on macOS*; that is *intentional*, so that
 * PKTAP files look the same on *all* OSes (different OSes can have
 * different numerical values for a given DLT_, but *MUST NOT* have
 * different values for what goes in a file, as files can be moved
 * between OSes!).
 *
 * When capturing, on a system with a Darwin-based OS, on a device
 * that returns 149 (DLT_USER2 and Apple's DLT_PKTAP) with this
 * version of libpcap, the DLT_ value for the pcap_t  will be DLT_PKTAP,
 * and that will continue to be DLT_USER2 on Darwin-based OSes. That way,
 * binary compatibility with Mavericks is preserved for programs using
 * this version of libpcap.  This does mean that if you were using
 * DLT_USER2 for some capture device on macOS, you can't do so with
 * this version of libpcap, just as you can't with Apple's libpcap -
 * on macOS, they define DLT_PKTAP to be DLT_USER2, so programs won't
 * be able to distinguish between PKTAP and whatever you were using
 * DLT_USER2 for.
 *
 * If the program saves the capture to a file using this version of
 * libpcap's pcap_dump code, the LINKTYPE_ value in the file will be
 * LINKTYPE_PKTAP, which will be 258, even on Darwin-based OSes.
 * That way, the file will *not* be a DLT_USER2 file.  That means
 * that the latest version of tcpdump, when built with this version
 * of libpcap, and sufficiently recent versions of Wireshark will
 * be able to read those files and interpret them correctly; however,
 * Apple's version of tcpdump in OS X 10.9 won't be able to handle
 * them.  (Hopefully, Apple will pick up this version of libpcap,
 * and the corresponding version of tcpdump, so that tcpdump will
 * be able to handle the old LINKTYPE_USER2 captures *and* the new
 * LINKTYPE_PKTAP captures.)
