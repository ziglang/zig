/*
 * Overall structure of dummynet

In dummynet, packets are selected with the firewall rules, and passed
to two different objects: PIPE or QUEUE (bad name).

A QUEUE defines a classifier, which groups packets into flows
according to a 'mask', puts them into independent queues (one
per flow) with configurable size and queue management policy,
and passes flows to a scheduler:

                 (flow_mask|sched_mask)  sched_mask
	 +---------+   weight Wx  +-------------+
         |         |->-[flow]-->--|             |-+
    -->--| QUEUE x |   ...        |             | |
         |         |->-[flow]-->--| SCHEDuler N | |
	 +---------+              |             | |
	     ...                  |             +--[LINK N]-->--
	 +---------+   weight Wy  |             | +--[LINK N]-->--
         |         |->-[flow]-->--|             | |
    -->--| QUEUE y |   ...        |             | |
         |         |->-[flow]-->--|             | |
	 +---------+              +-------------+ |
	                            +-------------+

Many QUEUE objects can connect to the same scheduler, each
QUEUE object can have its own set of parameters.

In turn, the SCHEDuler 'forks' multiple instances according
to a 'sched_mask', each instance manages its own set of queues
and transmits on a private instance of a configurable LINK.

A PIPE is a simplified version of the above, where there
is no flow_mask, and each scheduler instance handles a single queue.

The following data structures (visible from userland) describe
the objects used by dummynet:

 + dn_link, contains the main configuration parameters related
   to delay and bandwidth;
 + dn_profile describes a delay profile;
 + dn_flow describes the flow status (flow id, statistics)

 + dn_sch describes a scheduler
 + dn_fs describes a flowset (msk, weight, queue parameters)
