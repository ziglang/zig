 * specify the length of vendor-specific CDBs the target expects and
 * should normally be set to 0.  On successful completion
 * of enable, the specified target instance will answer selection.
 * Disable causes the target instance to abort any outstanding commands
 * and stop accepting new ones.  The aborted CCBs will be returned to
 * the user via read(2) or discarded if the user closes the device.
 * The user can then re-enable the device for a new path.
