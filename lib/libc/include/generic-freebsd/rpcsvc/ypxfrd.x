/*
 * This protocol definition file describes a file transfer
 * system used to very quickly move NIS maps from one host to
 * another. This is similar to what Sun does with their ypxfrd
 * protocol, but it must be stressed that this protocol is _NOT_
 * compatible with Sun's. There are a couple of reasons for this:
 *
 * 1) Sun's protocol is proprietary. The protocol definition is
 *    not freely available in any of the SunRPC source distributions,
 *    even though the NIS v2 protocol is.
 *
 * 2) The idea here is to transfer entire raw files rather than
 *    sending just the records. Sun uses ndbm for its NIS map files,
 *    while FreeBSD uses Berkeley DB. Both are hash databases, but the
 *    formats are incompatible, making it impossible for them to
 *    use each others' files. Even if FreeBSD adopted ndbm for its
 *    database format, FreeBSD/i386 is a little-endian OS and
 *    SunOS/SPARC is big-endian; ndbm is byte-order sensitive and
 *    not very smart about it, which means an attempt to read a
 *    database on a little-endian box that was created on a big-endian
 *    box (or vice-versa) can cause the ndbm code to eat itself.
 *    Luckily, Berkeley DB is able to deal with this situation in
 *    a more graceful manner.
 *
 * While the protocol is incompatible, the idea is the same: we just open
 * up a TCP pipe to the client and transfer the raw map database 
 * from the master server to the slave. This is many times faster than
 * the standard yppush/ypxfr transfer method since it saves us from
 * having to recreate the map databases via the DB library each time.
 * For example: creating a passwd database with 30,000 entries with yp_mkdb
 * can take a couple of minutes, but to just copy the file takes only a few
 * seconds.
