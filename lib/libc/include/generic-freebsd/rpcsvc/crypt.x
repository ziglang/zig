/*
 * This protocol definition exists because of the U.S. government and
 * its stupid export laws. We can't export DES code from the United
 * States to other countries (even though the code already exists
 * outside the U.S. -- go figure that one out) but we need to make
 * Secure RPC work. The normal way around this is to break the DES
 * code out into a shared library; we can then provide a dummy lib
 * in the base OS and provide the real lib in the secure dist, which
 * the user can install later. But we need Secure RPC for NIS+, and
 * there are several system programs that use NIS+ which are statically
 * linked. We would have to provide replacements for these programs
 * in the secure dist, but there are a lot, and this is a pain. The
 * shared lib trick won't work for these programs, and we can't change
 * them once they're compiled.
 *
 * One solution for this problem is to do the DES encryption as a system
 * call; no programs need to be changed and we can even supply the DES
 * support as an LKM. But this bloats the kernel. Maybe if we have
 * Secure NFS one day this will be worth it, but for now we should keep
 * this mess in user space.
 *
 * So we have this second solution: we provide a server that does the
 * DES encryption for us. In this case, the server is keyserv (we need
 * it to make Secure RPC work anyway) and we use this protocol to ship
 * the data back and forth between keyserv and the application.
