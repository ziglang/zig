/* ARC FPU control register bits.

  [  0] -> IVE: Enable invalid operation exception.
           if 0, soft exception: status register IV flag set.
           if 1, hardware exception trap (not supported in Linux yet).
  [  1] -> DZE: Enable division by zero exception.
           if 0, soft exception: status register IV flag set.
           if 1, hardware exception: (not supported in Linux yet).
  [9:8] -> RM: Rounding Mode:
           00 - Rounding toward zero.
           01 - Rounding to nearest (default).
           10 - Rounding (up) toward plus infinity.
           11 - Rounding (down)toward minus infinity.

   ARC FPU status register bits.

   [ 0] -> IV: flag invalid operation.
   [ 1] -> DZ: flag division by zero.
   [ 2] -> OV: flag Overflow operation.
   [ 3] -> UV: flag Underflow operation.
   [ 4] -> IX: flag Inexact operation.
   [31] -> FWE: Flag Write Enable.
           If 1, above flags writable explicitly (clearing),
           else IoW and only writable indirectly via bits [12:7].  */
