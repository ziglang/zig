 * The shmid64_ds structure for the MIPS architecture.
 * Note extra padding because this structure is passed back and forth
 * between kernel and user space.
 *
 * As MIPS was lacking proper padding after shm_?time, we use 48 bits
 * of the padding at the end to store a few additional bits of the time.
 * libc implementations need to take care to convert this into a proper
 * data structure when moving to 64-bit time_t.
