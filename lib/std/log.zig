//! std.log is a standardized interface for logging which allows for the logging
//! of programs and libraries using this interface to be formatted and filtered
//! by the implementer of the root.log function.
//!
//! Each log message has an associated scope enum, which can be used to give
//! context to the logging. The logging functions in std.log implicitly use a
//! scope of .default.
//!
//! A logging namespace using a custom scope can be created using the
//! std.log.scoped function, passing the scope as an argument; the logging
//! functions in the resulting struct use the provided scope parameter.
//! For example, a library called 'libfoo' might use
//! `const log = std.log.scoped(.libfoo);` to use .libfoo as the scope of its
//! log messages.
//!
//! An example root.log might look something like this:
//!
//! ```
//! const std = @import("std");
//!
//! // Set the log level to warning
//! pub const log_level: std.log.Level = .warn;
//!
//! // Define root.log to override the std implementation
//! pub fn log(
//!     comptime level: std.log.Level,
//!     comptime scope: @TypeOf(.EnumLiteral),
//!     comptime format: []const u8,
//!     args: anytype,
//! ) void {
//!     // Ignore all non-critical logging from sources other than
//!     // .my_project, .nice_library and .default
//!     const scope_prefix = "(" ++ switch (scope) {
//!         .my_project, .nice_library, .default => @tagName(scope),
//!         else => if (@enumToInt(level) <= @enumToInt(std.log.Level.crit))
//!             @tagName(scope)
//!         else
//!             return,
//!     } ++ "): ";
//!
//!     const prefix = "[" ++ @tagName(level) ++ "] " ++ scope_prefix;
//!
//!     // Print the message to stderr, silently ignoring any errors
//!     const held = std.debug.getStderrMutex().acquire();
//!     defer held.release();
//!     const stderr = std.io.getStdErr().writer();
//!     nosuspend stderr.print(prefix ++ format ++ "\n", args) catch return;
//! }
//!
//! pub fn main() void {
//!     // Using the default scope:
//!     std.log.info("Just a simple informational log message", .{}); // Won't be printed as log_level is .warn
//!     std.log.warn("Flux capacitor is starting to overheat", .{});
//!
//!     // Using scoped logging:
//!     const my_project_log = std.log.scoped(.my_project);
//!     const nice_library_log = std.log.scoped(.nice_library);
//!     const verbose_lib_log = std.log.scoped(.verbose_lib);
//!
//!     my_project_log.info("Starting up", .{}); // Won't be printed as log_level is .warn
//!     nice_library_log.err("Something went very wrong, sorry", .{});
//!     verbose_lib_log.err("Added 1 + 1: {}", .{1 + 1}); // Won't be printed as it gets filtered out by our log function
//! }
//! ```
//! Which produces the following output:
//! ```
//! [warn] (default): Flux capacitor is starting to overheat
//! [err] (nice_library): Something went very wrong, sorry
