This directory contains all the include files needed to build cpython
extensions with PyPy.  Note that these are just copies of the original headers
that are in pypy/module/cpyext/{include,parse}: they are automatically copied
from there during translation.

Moreover, some pypy-specific files are automatically generated, also during
translation. Currently they are:
* pypy_decl.h
* pypy_macros.h
* pypy_numpy.h
* pypy_structmember_decl.h
